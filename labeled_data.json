And who likes to struggle? \n\nMost students who say they hate math don't REALLY hate it, but instead, they hate feeling like a failure. They hate all these numbers they have to memorize or processes they have to memorize. Nobody told them why it's important in terms they understand, so they feel it's busy work and that's just not fun. So slowly they start to not care until they're forced to care or be retained.\n\nSometimes it's the teachers, or parents, or students. Sometimes it's all three. But the point is that people like success, and dislike failure. Math is one of those subjects where if you didn't do well one year, odds are you aren't going to be good at it next year since each subsequent year depends a lot on the developed skills of the previous year.\n\nIt's a slippery slope. One bad year will lead to a decade of frustration. And almost everyone has a difficult time at one point or another. The problem is other people /mostly teachers/ simply leave them where they are.",

(Even if they saved the extra $5 a week a ticket would cost) \nKnowing the odds and understanding that it will in 99.99999 percent of the time not pay for itself doesn\u2019t take into account the fact that the thought and hope of a chance at a completely different lifestyle can drastically improve someone\u2019s life.\n\n$5 dollars a week helps me get through 60 hours of work, gives me wonderful things to daydream about, helps me enjoy watching content about cars I will never be able to afford, and gives me 2 times a week during the draw something to get excited about. That\u2019s a better investment than 99% of things I would spend that $5 on otherwise.\n\nFor People that don\u2019t feel this way it\u2019s fine, but for those that do. It is a very worthwhile investment.\n\n\nEdit: A couple of notes.\nThis was apparently indeed an unpopular opinion.\n\n1. A lot of people seem to have a problem with the word \u201cinvestment\u201d as for them this is aways means a financial investment with positive expected financial returns. I understand this and should have possibly used another word. but as the very first sentence says I have no EXPECTATIONS of positive financial returns. \n\n2. Lottery also seems to have multiple different meanings. Where I am from the lottery is the euro jackpot, twice weekly drawn, \u20ac10 million- 120\u20ac million ball lottery. Each ticket cost 2\u20ac. I have never bought scratch it cards, or similar.\n\n3. I am talking about people in a financial secure position that can SPARE $5. I work hard, save well, invest a much larger portion of my income than $20 a month. But instead of a Big Mac, or brand name shoes, I buy $5 worth of tickets. If you can\u2019t afford $5 a week on \u201cluxury items\u201d then don\u2019t buy a ticket.\n\n4. Finally. Maybe I should not of used the word \u201chope\u201d either. I love my life as is and as I said I am financially in a decent place and well on my way to a comfortable life and even slightly earlier retirement. Even if I saved that $5 a week and invested it I would see a difference of about  $20,000 by the time I\u2019m 65. This isn\u2019t an insignificant amount of money, but for me personally it probably won\u2019t change the last 15ish years of my life that much. \n$50,000,000 would however change my life dramatically, and for longer than 15ish years ",

But the downsides outweigh any upside that even it couldn\u2019t claim as uniquely theirs. \n\nFirst, it really is a way for students and alumni to do stupid things outside (or on the periphery) of university governance. In this end, it\u2019s just a continuation of high school cliques when people should actually be much more integrated into the university itself.\n\nSecond, the idea of rushing/pledging is a dumb ritual to create the veneer of exclusivity and merit, when really it\u2019s just a form of unnecessary hazing. It also generates a culture of elitism that has no place in society and does a poor job preparing anyone for the real world after college.\n\nThird, the bad rep they tend to have on campus just confirms how little the university as a whole benefits from these. Not only do \u201cfrat houses\u201d actually take away property from actual folks living in the community near the university, but they\u2019re generally disruptive and a safety hazard most weekends due to excessive partying.\n\n",

Those same people might even decry the thought of taking on the responsibility of parenthood, and oftentimes use that effort they put into making money for someone else as a reason why not to have kids. \n\nLike I've heard about students putting in massive hours and again, sleepless nights for months on end. If you're a medical student it'll likely be years before you are stable. If you're in the trades you could get permanently injured or have no time for yourself. If you get a high degree you might not have a much money as others in your age group due to student loan debt. If you're in a field that involves caringfor others then a mistake could cost someone else dearly or you might not even be situated for the work and now that effort you put in is fundamentally wasted. You then work until either you die early or can save enough to retire all old and less invigorated than when you were younger.  \n\nAsk them about kids though and those exact same reasons become the very reasons why they won't have any, lack of time,  the commitment for years, the sleepless nights, the short on money, maybe you won't be happy, maybe you'll make a mistake... these are all somwhow unacceptable sacrifices for kids but when it comes to fattening your employer's wallet everyone wants to fall all over themselves biting for that carrot.

I cannot stress this enough when I say that it is a fantastic thing to do and working on public speaking is a great thing to practice. However, if your version of comedy is talking to people who are offstage and then asking them more and more questions which then you laugh at, and then the audience laughs at you are not a comedian, you are talking to somebody. \n\nI went to Gabriel Iglesias\u2019s show, as well as Tom Segura. Two professional comedians then I went to about three TikTokers comedy show and was very disappointed at most of their jokes. Lot of them were small jokes, which then let up to an interview with the audience and then asking questions. \n\n\u201cdoes anybody here do this? how many people do this?\u201d THAT IS NOT A JOKE. It can however, I will admit, lead to a joke. But if you are going in hoping that somebody has an odd job, that you can make quick simple, bounceable  jokes you are not a comedian. I understand the comedy is a subjective thing and not one person could have the best humor and maybe their thing is talking to somebody off stage but then you\u2019re not really a comedian I mean I\u2019m sorry, but that\u2019s just my opinion.\n\nEdit: Perhaps I should rephrase, my point is that if you are trying to be a comedian, and the jokes/laughter you get from the audience is the important part of your routine, that means that to an extent the person on the stage can be swapped out for someone else. Your routine should have some kind of monologue and punchline not working off of someone else\u2019s life experience unless you were there aswell",

Usually they reflect *their* likes and interests, not those of the recipient. They\u2019re also the result of some of compulsive shopping habits that reflect this \u201cshop till you drop\u201d mentality that\u2019s infected the minds of too many people living in capitalist societies. \n\nIt is better to give gifts that are hand crafted, well-made, and thrifted with purpose than it is to spend money on soulless mass-produced junk.\n\nTL;DR Don\u2019t give someone a gift unless you\u2019ve taken the time to make it thoughtful in some way. \n\nEDIT: A few things that commenters brought to mind:\n1) Gift-giving should be a choice, not a compulsion. I agree with many of the commenters here who have said that thoughtful cards are more than enough.\n2) Money is a great gift, always. It\u2019s one way of showing support for either what\u2019s needed or wanted without judgment or pretense.\n3) Don\u2019t know what to buy someone? Anxious about getting it wrong? Write a note, give a gift card or cash, or simply have the courage to ask them what they\u2019d like. \n4) So many people saying that I\u2019m ungrateful or lack compassion, or suggesting that I\u2019m hoity-toity\u2014if you read my post carefully you\u2019d have noticed I didn\u2019t say that gifts must/should be given.

My point is that people\u2019s conception of \u201cgift-giving\u201d is so warped by capitalism at this point that the act of buying someone something, especially if it\u2019s expensive or in multiples, is valued over intentionality and quality. \n5) I always receive unwanted gifts graciously, as one should. There\u2019s no reason to be rude or harsh toward someone. However, there\u2019s this secret shame that comes with this: of not liking the gift, of feeling like a bad person for not wanting it, etc. This is inherently unfair and makes gift-giving about the gifter and not the recipient. \n6) Not to mention having to now regift, donate, or throw something away. And then being asked about the gift later and then having to lie to appease these folks\u2019 egos. ",

This person slouched and looked disinterested during a meeting. A second person looked at and picked her hair during meetings. A guy wrote questionable things in his DevOps. Finding fault in other people and then gossiping about it was fun for her. She would come up to you, ask you what you thought of some other coworker who may have a mildly annoying habit quality, and if you don't say anything negative she would then lightly mention the trait that was mildly annoying. If you just agree that yes, that one trait is annoying, she would go to more coworkers and say that it was YOU who couldn't stand the coworker with a mildly annoying habit. It escalated until she was saying everyone doesn't like this person or that person. She did crap like that throughout the office. She was always looking for something new to criticize and it was her entertainment. Oh, and she had a PhD in bioinformatics so it wasn't a case of someone being poorly educated.\n\nSome people absolutely enjoy criticizing others, which is why celebrity tabloids have not gone bankrupt after all these years. Why some celebrities have anti-fans. Some people care more about a celebrity's dating life than the celebrity themselves. There are a lot of people out there who enjoy fixating on others.",

The thing is, most people label automation itself as the bad guy. Automation in general is a good thing. As humanity evolves, we have eliminated outdated jobs. In the past, plow animals and tools replaced humans, and machinery replaced plow animals. As technology evolves, human lives should get simpler and easier.\n\nThe issue is that our societies rely on jobs. We are not prepared for low entry jobs to be eliminated, as thousands of people will not have the means to earn the needs of life. Instead of allowing lives to continue to get simpler, and working hours continue to shrink, we've expected people to continue working the same amount even though the workload is lessened. \n\nThis is also shown in the WFH movement. Once WFH was made more popular, there were people working 3+ jobs at the same time due to the workload really only needing a few hours from them. In today's society you need someone to pay for hours of your life, not just for a task to be completed. The more things that come out that reduce the amount of hours needed should be seen as a good thing, but without any safety nets in place, it does more harm than good for the working class.",

        "text": "I'm tired of seeing people making fun of others just because they \"peaked\" in high school. You can peak in high school and still not be a loser in the adult world. I'm sorry some of you out there had a shit time in high school, I know teenagers can be mean, but just because you had a shit time doesn't mean everyone else has to feel bad about having a great time in their teenage years. I peaked in high school and I'm not afraid to say it. I have a great and steady career in a job I enjoy, I'm saving for a house, I have investments and savings, I have friends and family that I am close to and see regularly, I have hobbies that keep me happy and fulfilled in off work hours. But do you know what was way more fun?  Being in high school.\n\nI have to pay rent as an adult, I have to pay bills, I have to go grocery shopping, I have to cook meals on my own. You know when I didn't have to do any of that shit? When I was in high school. I worked so I could have money to buy a beat up car, gas, some beer/weed money but that was much less hours than the 40 I work now and I didn't have to commute for an hour everyday to clock in at Wendy's. And you know what the worst that would happen if I hated my job and I told the manager at wendys to fuck off? I just go home and look if McDonalds has any openings. If I told my manager to fuck off these days I have to explain to potential new employers why I left my last job and hope they don't call my old company to ask and if I don't find a new job in time I lose my car, my apartment, my savings, and my dignity.\n\nYou know what else you can do in high school that you can't as an adult? Slack off on your \"day job\". In school you just have to be there and you can stare at the wall and give half assed answers if you don't feel like participating that day. Yeah you have to complete homework, and quizzes, and tests but I knew some real dumb motherfuckers who put in zero effort and the school bends over backwards to get them graduated and out the door. In the real world if I stare at the wall all day and give half assed responses to my bosses questions I get reprimanded and possibly fired.\n\nYeah having to live under your parents rules can suck but sneaking around those rules and slipping out to smoke a doobie with your friends is an exhilarating experience you cant replicate just sitting on the couch in your apartment. All of your friends are also nearby in the same city so you don't have to plan get togethers a week in advance because you all live spaced out from each other. Not to mention you probably cant even all get together with a weeks notice because you all now have jobs and family and responsibilities. In high school you can just text the group chat and all meet up within 30 minutes.\n\nYou also get organized sports in high school. I was a multi sport varsity athlete and it was fucking awesome. You get your name in the paper, people praise you just because you can throw a ball well, our biggest football games against the cross town rival had crowds of 20,000 people to watch you play a game and they all cheer you on when you do something good. These days if I bragged about the hat trick I scored in men's league the night before no one would care and at work if I nail my quarterly report I get a \"good job\" from the boss and then its on to the next task.\n\nI'm not debating there are parts of adulthood that are better but I had way more fun on a daily basis in high school than I do as an adult toiling away at a desk for 40 hours a week looking forward to the 3 days of vacation I can finally take in a few months when I save up enough PTO (if my boss approves it). So I'm sorry some of you had a bad experience in high school but that doesn't mean you have to be bitter and make fun of others who may have had the best time of their lives.\n\nEdit: ok I get it people I had a different definition of peak than you do you don\u2019t need to be the 174th person to point it out",

(As a side note, if they have to spend hours each week talking through a poly or open relationship situation to keep convincing themselves they are comfortable with it, they probably aren't.)\n\nIn the truly good relationships I've had, we probably only talk about the \"state of the relationship\" about 3 times a year, if that. If you're doing it all the time, you're probably with the wrong person and need to break up.\n\nPeople keep repeating this phrase about how \"relationships take hard work,\" but I think good relationships just take good emotional self-regulation. The work you have to do is between you and you -- controlling your anger, controlling your insecurity, not being petty, doing your share of chores, trying to be a grown-up. It doesn't mean you should be constantly hashing out why the other person has upset you, how you both need to change, why you've disappointed them, why they've disappointed you, what you mean to each other, where things are going, etc. Those conversations rarely help and turn into another way of people manipulating each other during bad relationships. \n\nIf the whole relationship feels like work, you're probably with the wrong person.",

Yes, it's definitely sweet of somebody to get into the office in the morning and announce that they brought bagels or doughnuts; but if I've already eaten breakfast, then either I don't get to partake (which has the added risk of offending whomever brought the food), or I over-consume calories that morning. Or maybe they surprise the office with pizza for lunch. Always a good choice, except if I brought my lunch that day and it won't keep another day, then either food gets wasted or, again, we over-eat. Speaking of over-eating - if somebody is on a fitness journey and only gets one cheat-meal this week, it would be unfortunate if they used that up prior to learning pizza was being provided.\n\nSurprise meals provided at work are certainly done with good intentions, but it can add annoyance or frustration to those who have made their own meal arrangements because they were not aware the food was coming.\n\n  \nEdit: a common theme in the comments is that I simply don't have to partake. The nature of my post stems from the fact that I actually have received soft reprimands for not partaking. Even if I stand with the group without eating the food (so that I'm still there, socially speaking), I still receive that reprimand.\n\nAnother common theme is that I am bringing negativity to the workplace. Let me assure you all that I am NOT expressing any of my opinions in the workplace. I am silent. I over-eat when the pressure compels me to do so, and I dodge eating when it appears I can get away with it. I have not insisted more than anybody else that I was not hungry, and there has been zero attitude. Yes, I'll try to say I'm not hungry, but then comes the soft reprimand that I should eat the food in solidarity with my coworkers, and that's when I get faced with a choice. In those situations, I usually elicit a cheap joke, which garners some chuckles, and then eat the food being offered. ",

Our sentiment and hard work has become a game for such companies now.\n\nMany interviewers and people in jobs, what I've personally seen people do all day is justify that they work, and adapt this overly sensitive and fake attitude amongst their peers. Their behaviour and language sometimes actually feels like Chat GPT under human flesh. \n\nI highly respect and love people who are realistic and honest with their personalities, and are clear and concise. E.g., telling someone \"This time you messed up but next time do better\" rather than \"on this occasion your actions were not in line with our company's expectations\" etc etc. \n\nAlso, I feel LinkedIn becomes more and more fake everyday, where people seek to portray a false personality of themselves - \"I am beyond thrilled and excited to embark on this new adventure in my aim to assist new possibilities blah blah blah\".\n\nI personally feel the real work culture should be back.

But turning a passion into work often leads to burnout, stress, and disillusionment with something that once brought joy. When your passion becomes tied to deadlines, financial pressures, and external expectations, it can deform and corrupt the original love you had for it.\n\nMoreover, the idea of having a \"dream job\" is largely a romanticized, Western concept. It stems from a culture that places immense value on individual fulfillment through work. The notion that we should all find one passion overshadows the reality that most people have multiple interests and skills, not just one singular calling. Forcing these passions into the confines of a job can diminish their value, turning something you once loved into just another task on your to-do list. In reality, it\u2019s okay for work to just be a way to pay the bills, allowing you to pursue your true passions in your free time without the burdens of monetizing them",

        "text": "A sentiment I commonly see when strangers behaving poorly in public is complained about is that you should be expected to confront them first to ask them to stop politely. I've even commonly seen people ridiculed for failing to do so and mocked for not speaking up or for reporting them to an authority (not necessarily police) without ever engaging them directly.\n\n\nI'm talking about situations where someone complains about someone doing something like playing loud music at night, not picking up after their dogs, casually blocking a high traffic path with a shopping cart, taking up too much public seating when little is available, etc.\n\nA specific example that comes to mind is how many people I've talked to seem think I was immature for reporting my apartment neighbor to my apartment management for playing loud bass heavy music after midnight that was shaking my walls. Apparently, I should have knocked and asked them to stop first. I don't disagree that this is a good step to take. I just don't think that it should be an expectation.\n\nI'm of the opinion that people shouldn't have to do this. We shouldn't be expected to confront people as a default. People shouldn't have to be asked to not be a nuisance in public. They should just not be a nuisance to begin with. My desire to not have to confront someone who engages in inconsiderate behavior is higher than my desire to rid myself of a minor nuisance. Having to instruct a stranger on proper public etiquette is often more annoying than than that etiquette being violated.\n\nPeople are not entitled to the opportunity to have strangers around them monitor their behavior to guide them to behave acceptably. They should conduct their manners appropriately on their own.\n\nI have literally never had to have someone ask me to stop being a nuisance. Because I am considerate and pay attention to how my behavior is affecting my surroundings. Why afford inconsiderate people the privilege of hand holding them on public etiquette?\n\nPay attention to how your behavior is affecting those around you. Its not other people's job to do that for you. You don't get points for being apologetic and stopping AFTER being confronted. Too many people just do whatever the hell they want expecting other people to let them know when they've crossed a line. They are always exude an obnoxious confidence and don't spend any mental energy preemptively being considerate.\n\nBeing considerate isn't passive. Its active. You have to think about it and pay attention. If you aren't ACTIVELY being considerate in public then you are being inconsiderate, and there is no way you aren't bothering people around you constantly while being blissfully unaware.",

It also becomes a self-perpetuating financial grift, inflating tuition fees disproportionately, with students deferring those fees through loans. Those loans then create interest which goes back partly to the universities and partly to governments, like a cunning tax scheme. Also, as a higher % of kids go to university, there are fewer of the very smart kids and the cohort becomes steadily more average. That means that the courses get steadily dumbed down until students learn less complex things than they would have say 20, 30, 40 years ago. So they pay more for way less, while the government and the education sector soaks up the money and keeps expanding. Until hopefully one day - POP!!!",

I do think that tends to be true and common enough, except that it\u2019s actually appropriate as we grow older but our concept of friendship has not matured with us. And it\u2019s a call for us to be intentional about developing and keeping friendships\n\nIn younger years, friendships are often due to proximity and availability. This means we get a lot of time to spend with people, from a schedule that other people plans, and bond over shared experiences (being in school, mainly), as opposed to shared values. It doesn\u2019t require a lot of intentionality or effort to keep friendships. And complacency is actually rewarded. (Avoidance of conflict, being \u201cjust there\u201d, etc.)\n\nWhen we grow into adulthood and have more responsibilities plus distance, we actually need to focus on making time for connections, and be more intentional about what we seek to give and receive from others. We also need to learn to make do when life circumstances, ours or others, require time apart. That also means we get to learn the importance of being well when we\u2019re alone.\n\nSo I do believe it is more difficult to make friends as adult, especially if we tend toward low effort with people, but learning to navigate it in a more difficult setting is supposed to be one of the things that help us become more well rounded over time.",

In fact, you will never find peace if you forgive people when you're not really ready but feel pressured to forgive because you've been led to believe that it's the noble, virtuous thing to do as a good human being. \n\nNot forgiving someone isn't the same as you not being able to *move on* from what they did to you. You can go on just fine with the rest of your life, be happy and still feel like whatever this person did to you wasn't ok and that they're not worthy of your forgiveness. You'll definitely be able to find peace, because you're standing up for yourself. \n\nI was trying really hard to forgive someone I used to be friends with, who wrongfully accused me of something terrible (although they never really asked for forgiveness) because I thought forgiving was the *right* thing to do and in the past it has always come naturally to me -- but this time I realized, I didn't want to forgive them because I just wasn't ok with them betraying my trust and disrespecting me. And accepting that I can't force myself to forgive someone when I authentically don't feel like it, has brought me peace :)",

        "text": "The first Gen Viper was relatively more affordable and a more radical departure from daily driver performance than previous factory hot rods. \n\nLet me 'splain. \n\nWhat was the average person driving in 1995? A fwd econobox with ~150-220 horsepower, a 4-speed auto, 205 or 215 series 16\" tires, airbags, abs, collapsible steering wheel, shoulder belts, etc- slow, safe, and predictable. \n\nThe best selling car in 1995 was the Taurus- dead center on all those stats. \n\n1995 Viper? 400 horsepower, RWD, 6-speed manual, summer compound 275/40R17 front / 335/35R17 rear tires, no abs, no traction control, etc. \n\nThe Viper cost ~1.35 times the average MSRP of a new car in 1985.\n\nNow, let's look at the apex of factory hot rods at the apex of the 1960s horsepower war- the 1969 ZL-1 Corvette. \n\nWhile there was a much larger range of engine (and therefore horsepower) options in 1969, the average car in 1969 had lap belts and no other safety features, a 6 or 8 cylinder with 150-225 horsepower, 205-215 width 14 or 15\" tires, and a 3 speed auto or 3-4 speed manual. \n\n1969 ZL-1 'Vette? ~450 horsepower, lap belts and nothing else, 225 width 15\" tires, and a 4 speed manual. \n\nThe ZL-1 cost ~1.75 times the average MSRP of a new car in 1969. \n\nNow, sure, there's a lot of variability here, but the basics are obvious: while both the Viper and the ZL-1 (or GT500, or Hemi 'Cuda, or COPO Camaro) roughly double the horsepower of the average family car in their day, the Viper has far fewer safety measures, a far greater performance envelope, and is far more affordable to the average dentist than a late '60s supercar. \n\nIf you bolted the ZL-1's polyglas Goodyears onto a 1969 SS350 Camaro it wouldn't really change the look or performance. \n\nPut 275ZR17 summer tires on a '95 Taurus and see what happens. \n\nIn conclusion: if you stepped from a 383 RoadRunner (300 or so hp) into a ZL-1 (~475 hp) in 1969 you spent more money and generated more tire smoke, but your performance and handling weren't radically different and you already expected your daily driver to try to kill you.\n\nIf you stepped from a 1995 Supra (with 300 hp) into a Viper you got a car that was radically more capable with far fewer electronic nannies. \n\nBecause the Viper was (comparably) much more affordable to the average buyer in 1995, more realistically you were stepping from a ~250 hp Camaro, Porsche, or BMW with ABS and traction control into a 400 hp Viper with none of those things. \n\nSo, like I said, the Viper was purchased and driven by people with the wrong expectations in a way late 60's monsters weren't.

I can actually just enjoy watching, and some of the ads that do come on are just teasers for other TV shows in the same mood! \n\nGot me really thinking I want to pay for cable again. \n\nEdit - Going to add a general comment for context. If I\u2019m not mistaken, French TV limits ad time to 12 minutes maximum per hour, with an average of 6-9 minutes. Cursory research shows I can get a subscription for around 10-15 euros, although I invite my fellow francophones to share their experiences/knowledge and correct me if I\u2019m wrong ",

The CFL, while cherished by some, faces declining viewership, financial instability, archaic rules dating back to the 1800s and a limited talent pool compared to the NFL. By introducing NFL teams into Canada, fans would gain access to the highest caliber of competition, uniting North America under a single football standard.\n\nThis shift would also stimulate the growth of high school and college football in Canada, which has largely stagnated. With the NFL's presence, more resources, visibility, and opportunities would be available to young Canadian athletes. This would lead to increased participation and development at the grassroots level, creating a stronger pipeline for future talent.\n\nFurthermore, an NFL expansion into Canada would spark thrilling new rivalries, like Vancouver versus Seattle or Toronto against Buffalo, energizing fan bases and regional pride. For fans, an NFL presence would offer a more consistent and familiar product, drawing larger crowds and sponsorships. Tradition is important, but the future of football in Canada lies in unifying with the NFL to ensure long-term growth, competitiveness, and international appeal.",

No NBA expansion team is gonna be in the finals year 1 because the NBA is way too deep) \n\nWith Pittsburgh you would be adding a team on the east coast to offset a team on the west coast instead of 2 west coast teams (which would cause the NBA to have to reshuffle the conferences which are already a mess geography wise). Pittsburgh would also have dedicated fans day 1 considering they always support the Steelers and the Pirates have maintained a solid fanbase despite the fact they\u2019ve sucked for the past 8 years.

People often respond with \"why does it matter?\" or \"it's mirrored because it's a selfie\" (but, they don't say why a selfie should be mirrored).  A lot of people seem to treat this as if it's a normal thing - but before smartphones, I had never seen any camera save photos mirrored.  You'd have to manually flip it if you wanted it to appear that way.\n\nSmartphone camera software these days often save selfie photos flipped horizontally, like you're looking in a mirror.  I've never understood why they do this, or why any of the phone developers thought this would be a good idea.  People share selfies on social media fairly often, and often, it's obvious that they're mirrored, because text is backwards, etc..  IMO it looks a bit weird.  I've even seen at least one where the person posting said something like \"check out my shirt\", and the text was mirrored..  They could have made it a bit easier to read by sharing a non-mirrored photo.  Even if there isn't any text or obvious signs, I think a photo being shared should basically represent reality.  I wouldn't want to share photos that would make someone appear right-handed when they're actually left-handed, or if I'm sitting in my car, I wouldn't want to make it look like my car is right-hand drive when it's actually left-hand drive, etc..\n\nSmartphone camera software often has an option to disable saving this way (and I do have mine disabled), but I don't know why this was ever a thing in the first place.  And with my current phone (Google Pixel 8), if I text a selfie to someone, it seems it saves the selfie mirrored, regardless of the fact that I have that option disabled.

Where do we draw the line on what is too dangerous?  \n\nSince the dawn of civilization we have had one on one contests for glory and profit as well as entertainment. We have set aside for the most part contests to the death or cripling injury such as unprotected fighting with edged weapons, and we have been hovering at the level set by boxing and now MMA. Violent, sometimes ugly... but even then there are rules to mitigate injury. Modern fighting with blunt instruments or swords involves armor and strict rules. And the more extreme forms of bare knuckle and unregulated underground fighting are often rejected like we reject dog fighting and cock fighting.\n\nBut amidst the modern conversation of CTE and brain injury affecting popular sports, we now see Slap Fighting. No chance to avoid injury. There can be no debate... it is literally mashing the brains of people against the insides of their skull. EVERY hit is the same as the worst hit a fighter takes in a match, possibly a career. It is the concentration of the worst parts of boxing, and that is ALL it is. There is no art or chance to avoid anything. \n\nIn summation... I already have a tough time with many combat sports but at least they have a CHANCE at avoiding the worst of it - they are an actual test of one's self and opponent. It makes me sick that Slap Fighting is compared to the more brutal sports, much less the noble combat sports like BJJ and Arm Wrestling. I believe only bad things can come of it, and anyone who supports Slap Fighting is making a moral and ethical mistake. It is not a martial art, it is not a risk or test, it is only pure self destruction and currently one of the lowest forms of entertainment.",

        "text": "People are quick to claim we've moved past the brutal practices of history, like burning women for witchcraft or the horrors of slavery. Yet today, emotions and groupthink still cloud our judgment-when a collective shares a sentiment, many are quick to adopt it without questioning its validity. This makes it easy to fall into the same mindsets that existed in the past. For instance, during the early 20th century, there was mass hysteria and fear during the Red Scare, where innocent people were accused of being communists, often with little evidence. While these examples may seem less extreme than the barbaric practices of the past, the amount of blinded emotion today suggests that, left unchecked, people could just as easily commit atrocious acts.\nThis is evident even in extreme, unwarranted 'hate trains' over trivial issues. We see people piling on hate for something as minor as being annoying or mildly problematic-where many join in on the outrage without genuinely caring about what the person did. A good example is cancel culture, where someone's mistake-whether it's a poorly worded tweet or a past behaviour (excluding bigotry)-is met with excessive outrage and attacks, even if most people don't care that much about the issue. People are quick to jump on the bandwagon without thinking critically. This shows that our collective behavior mirrors past barbaric practices, proving human nature hasn't evolved as much as we'd like to think. while we\u2019ve evolved away from these particular acts, the mechanisms that allowed them to happen\u2014emotional manipulation, fear-based decision-making, and groupthink\u2014are still very much present.\n\n",

Also he\u2019s unfunny.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nMy understanding of the whole affair is as follows:\n\n1. Jay Leno didn\u2019t want to retire. He was pushed out by the studio.\n2. Upon being pushed out, he indicated that he would seek employment elsewhere.\n3. Not wanting him working for a competing network, the studio instead gave him a show with an earlier slot.\n4. The earlier slot split the audience \u2013 Conan\u2019s show suffered as a result.\n5. The studio reneged on Conan, and cut him a fat cheque for his troubles. Leno resumed as host of the Tonight Show.\n\nI\u2019m gob smacked that anyone can see this order of events and think that Leno did anything wrong here. Can you imagine, in your personal life, having your dream job and your bosses being like \u201cWe want you to retire so that we can bring in a younger guy who we like more. That\u2019s cool right? Also please sign this non-compete agreement and go away.\u201d\n\nNo effing way. Of course you\u2019d fight tooth and nail to hang on. Anyone calling you an asshole for doing so would be laughed out of the room.\n\nLeno didn\u2019t owe anything to Conan. Was Conan done dirty by the studio? Sure. But that\u2019s not on Leno. He\u2019s not responsible for him or his career. Further, I think Conan was (and continued to be) doing just fine without the gig, so the overflow of sympathy for someone that wealthy and privileged was/is unwarranted.\n\nWhenever these events comes up, there\u2019s also a piece about how Leno was never particularly funny. I think that this is subjective and irrelevant. He had a stellar run as host of the show, regardless of anyone\u2019s opinion about his comedic value. Clearly some people found him enjoyable to watch. I think that\u2019s an objective truth.\n\nLastly, Leno just generally seems like a good dude. Eff the haters.

        "text": "I often see this sentiment where if you actively do something (or have done something) and talk against it, you're just a hypocrite. That's not even logical and it's complete bullshit to anyone that actually thinks about it. \n\nExample; someone that smokes tobacco telling people that smoking tobacco is negative and stupid. You'll always get offended people complaining about \"well YOU do it!!\" but it's like no shit, that's literally why I'm talking about it and that's literally why I have the qualifications and justification to talk about it. It isn't even logical to call someone a hypocrite. Every addicted smoker on earth should know it's stupid and they just push people away from the addiction. Any logical smoker that's mature enough to admit their problems would do just that. If you have literal experience and knowledge of something, it makes logical sense to share that knowledge. Who is someone going to listen to more; someone that's actually been through it and living through it, or someone that just read a few online articles? Come on now. \n\nBut the thing is, people are so half assed on what they call hypocrite. They usually only call someone a hypocrite when it's about something they personally feel some kind of way about, regardless if what they're saying is the truth. Like to bring me back to the original example; just because I/someone smokes tobacco, that literally doesn't change anything that's being stated or the truth behind it. Being offended that someone that's there/been there is talking negatively about it is just ignorant. With experience comes wisdom, with wisdom comes life lessons. That's just the way it goes. \n\nAlmost everyone laughs, claps and cheers for inmates in prison that do the \"beyond scared straight\" programs; showing the youth their mistakes and where it could bring them. Talking against the things they used to do doesn't make them a hypocrite, it makes them someone that's sharing firsthand, secondhand and third hand knowledge. Just because someone doesn't like what's being stated doesn't magically make them a hypocrite. It means they're teaching and influencing people to not make those same decisions. \n\nThere's a line though. Is it \"wrong\" for someone to make another out to be the most fucked up person in existence when they currently do the same things as them? In a way, yeah, that would be hypocrisy, but either way that doesn't magically change or remove the fact that their actions could use adjusting. People all too often get sensitive about what someone says, call them a hypocrite and then just completely shut out anything logical that's being stated. Ignoring logic because you don't like who's saying it (or how it's being said) is just immature ignorance. You don't need to like who's saying it, you don't need to like how it's being said, but actively ignoring the truth behind the statements is arrogance. And if it's coming from someone that's literally living that life? Just quit getting offended and be open/mature enough to hear them out. \n\nMoral of the post; quit calling everyone that has experience with something a hypocrite when they talk against it. That's what happens when people want to teach and push others to do better than them. Are you not gonna listen to a drug addict telling you not to get into the drugs they're doing because it'll ruin your life, just because you arrogantly don't want to listen? \n\nNothing everything is being a hypocrite lol. \n\nHope everyone is doing good. Hope everyone in your lives is healthy and alive. Enjoy the rest of your Monday. ",

It\u2019s about finding what feels right for you and what makes you feel like the most authentic version of yourself.\n\nIf someone\u2019s into minimalism, maybe it\u2019s because they want more peace and simplicity in their life. If someone\u2019s embracing bright colors and chaotic styles, maybe it reflects their bold personality. It\u2019s not just \u201csuperficial,\u201d it\u2019s a reflection of who they are and what they value.\n\nI think people are quick to dismiss aesthetics because they associate them with vanity or consumerism, but when used thoughtfully, they can be powerful tools for self-expression and even personal growth.\n\nSo, exploring aesthetics isn\u2019t shallow\u2014it\u2019s a real way to discover and express your authentic self. \nWhat do you think?",

Shows like skins and euphoria, as much as I liked skins too back in the day, ended up glorifying harmful behaviors like eating disorders and substance-abuse without showing the hard choices/consequences/effects, whereas Degrassi showed us that there are choices to make in life as teens and healthy ways to go about these developmentally significant events we face as western teenagers and presents a pretty decent risk/benefit analysis that is age appropriate with a range of perspectives on the issue du jour. They pose issues without judgment or chastising. I truly don\u2019t think any \u201cedgy\u201d teen media has done like Degrassi before or ever since. ",

If we want to have any chance of fighting against dis-information, we need to hold people accountable.\n\nI have heard two main arguments against providing sources.\n\n1. \"Do your own research\". Of course people should do their own research. But, that fact is not an excuse for one to not back up their claim. In fact, someone could do their own research AND ask for the source for the claim that someone is making. Furthermore, wouldn't you want to see the piece(s) of evidence that convinced who your talking with? You may be convinced right away but either way you could evaluate the legitimacy of the source.\n\n\n2. \"People that ask for a source are disingenuous\". If that's the case, then that is their issue. You can still supply the source that convinced you of your claim and that would be up to the other person to actually look at it or change their mind. If they're looking for some sort of \"Gotcha\" moment because you're unable to back up your claim, then you can turn that around on them by providing evidence.\n\n\nBottom line, there's no good reason to withhold the evidence you have for a claim. Unless, you don't actually have evidence, in which case, why are you claiming something you have no proof for?",

Someone's favourite song by an artist is their most famous song. Someone's favourite food is the original flavour. Someone watches mainstream reality TV. And if you relate to this, you might have been called \"basic\" by someone else.\n\nIt's simple why I think this term is an odd insult. Things are popular for a reason. If you like something that a crowd of people likes, it should be a good thing, right? That you have opinions that a lot of people agree with. \n\nThe same goes the other way. Unique styles don't make you better than anyone else. If you like chains and fishnet gloves, go for it. Self-expression is a generally positive thing. But if you think you're better than the people who wear Lululemon and have Stanley cups, you're wrong. Art is subjective, and you shouldn't be putting down someone else's self-expression. \n\nHere's another example, with music. Your favourite singer can be Taylor Swift, and it can also be Nirvana or something. If your favourite composer is Beethoven, don't force yourself to like Schoenberg just to be different. Your favourite Sabrina Carpenter song could absolutely be Espresso, instead of finding a niche song made 6 years ago just to be unique.\n\nWe were always told to be ourselves, so why should we forget that?

My closest friends don't mind if I go months without messaging them or seeing them, we are still really good friends at the end of the day. Now though if I go, say 2 days without messaging a new friend, I'll find myself blocked or unfriended because I \"don't care about them\" which isn't the case. I could think really highly of them but they do that an now I don't.

        "text": "A TV-show, a movie, a book or any other piece of media that takes heavy inspiration from another story or is in many aspects kind of a \"rip-off\" of this story is not necessarily bad. To me it is the execution of the story which matters. Is it entertaining, is it well made with interesting characters, good cinematography and an exciting and interesting story? If yes, I don't care that if it is the 100th iteration of the same old trope.\n\nLet's be honest, is there any story that is really 100% original. Everything which can be said or told has already been said or told. We can vary these old stories, give them new interesting twists and it will be a masterpiece.\n\nA new \"original\" story with truly new ideas is not automatically good. If the story is boring, bland and poorly made it will not be saved by its originality. Often it is quite the opposite where the novelty is the only aspect that makes a story notable, but the lack in execution kills it.\n\nI would rather have the 10 millionth adaptation of Snow White if it is well made and interesting than this new flashy epic tale that falls flat on its nose.\n\nAn example is the anime series \"Darling in the Franxx\" which gets lots of hate for various reason, one of them being that it is said to be a rip-off of \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\". I personally loved the show despite thinking that some of the criticisms have some reason, but that DitF is an Evangelion rip-off is none of them. Yes, it has many elements that are heavily inspired from the other show, but it does not take away from its qualities. It is its own story with interesting characters and great developments. That many scenes are basically copies from Evangelion scenes does not spoil the fun for me.",

        "text": "A lot of people seem to dismiss and discredit things they don't immediately understand. There was a post here saying that David Lynch films were completely incomprehensible and therefore have no value, and don't know what they're talking about. While I understand that stories and art told in a non-literal way can be confusing, I think that there's often times a lot more beneath the surface. \n\nSurrealism as an art form started to become prevalent shortly after Sigmund Freud released his book The Interpretation of Dreams\n\nSurrealism is considered a dreamlike art form, and some of the most well known surrealists were also interested in exploring their connection to their dreams, and interpreting what their dreams meant on a deeper level.\n\nSalvador Dali especially loved the theoretical ideas of Freuds book, and considers it to be one the most life changing discoveries.\n\nThis connection between the two, psychology, and dreams, seems to set the ground for surrealism.\n\nIf you look at art, wether that be film, painting, literature, or music. Whatever form that uses surrealism, it's often not because the artists are just \"throwing spaghetti at the wall, to see what sticks.\" Through the lens of their dreams they are trying to express something about themselves that they may not even be conscious of. \n\nZdzslaw beksinki, a polish surrealist started painting because he wanted to \"paint his nightmares\" when he started expressing his dream through the surrealist lens, it often became a dystopian nightmarish hellscape, the images are very dark and cerebral. A lot of his work is of gaunt, withered, distorted figures that appear in some state of dispare, or large authoritarian figures that appear as domineering and aggressive. \n\nThis starts to make sense when you consider that beksinki was raised as a boy in a post world War one poland, and lived his years into adulthood through the second world War. The images he made were likely him trying to express the frustration the helplessness, the hunger, the evil that he saw going on around him every single day.\n\nI could go on for hours with more examples, Francis Bacon, Franz Kuafka, Kurt Vonnegut, Charlie Kuafman, David Lynch, so on... \n\nBut the point would be the same, all of them try to express something about themselves, or the world around them in a way that may not seem like it makes sense, but is often a very introspective and thought out and human exploration. Even if it's not a literal interpretation of the things happening in the image.\n\nImagine an image of a pomegranate sitting on white cloth. The background is pitch black, except the dough eyes of a sad woman peering out from the darkness, just barely visble, her tears fall behind the pomegranate. It's been stabed with a sharp blade. A large hand of a male has been cut off, and now grips the blades handle. The pomegranate leaks deep red juice, which leaves the white cloth stained, and soaked.\n\nWhat is this image? Is it just a pomegranate which has now been cut? Or is this the expression of a woman who cannot have children? The pomegranate representing her fertility, or rather her lack thereof. The hand representing not only the hand of a potential ex lover who has left her with this infertile state, but also one who has been detached, but still lingers with the blade inside of her. Taking forever from her, the one thing that was hers. \n\nSymbolism is important, it can convey so much that isn't spoken. \n\nEverything isn't literal. The more we try to make it literal, the less meaning it has. ",

Then in 2020 it crossed into $510,400. \n\nAt the end of this year and currently for many lenders, the limit just shifted up to $802,650 which is a 65% increase in just 5 years. \n\nNow whats interesting here is that from 2006-2016, the loan limit remained at 417,000. The average price of a home from 2006-2016 went from 247,700 to 311,00 over a decade for a 25% increase. \n\nAt the start of 2019 the average home was 313,000 and today sits around 412,000 which is a 32% increase in half the time. \n\nThere is a notable upswing from 2020 to just 2022 where a home was 329,000 to 437,700 and thats a 33% increase in just 2 years. \n\nLong of the short, housing is rising abnormally fast and the govt whom sets these limits has done nothing but encourage higher prices. \n\nIf loan limits were still back at the 500k level, we simply wouldn\u2019t see the pace of value increase so incredibly. You may want to sell your home for some egregious number, but good luck finding a buyer. Its this rolling of limits up that is the root problem of housing being so expensive. \n\nLenders specifically don\u2019t lend their own money, but the govt\u2019s money. If the loan forecloses, your bank takes no hit at all, but the govt pays them out. Mortgage insurance/PMI exists specifically to help the govt recoup forclosed property and payouts to lenders. \n\nEveryone talks about all these solutions to the craziness that is the housing market, but its as simple as the govt not blindly raising limits. One may say that this would price regular people out of loans, but this is false as the lenders wouldn\u2019t bother lending their own money anyways. Home would *have* to stay cheaper to accommodate demand. Thus the fix is much simpler than everyone makes it out to be. Stop raising these dam limits and all of a sudden people will be able to afford homes again. ",

Can we *please* drop the faux-philosophical undertones like this is some really intellectual, deep thing?\n\nAll I see is a 3d render of a space made by someone who cba or isn't capable of filling said space with detail like people, creatures, plants, etc. All I see is a game where the devs just made some levels and stopped developing right there an then while saying \"ooooh scary!\".\n\nYou know what we used to call a 3d model/render of an empty hallway? A beginner tutorial project.\n\nIt's dumb, no matter how deep you think liminality is. If you have to explain why your game or art is supposed to be scary, it's not scary.",

Yes, it was made on a small budget. It has glitches. It's not polished like RDR and definitely not a \"AAA\" game. However, no other game does what KCD does. A grounded story based in reality. No \"save the world\" going on. It's a very personal story. The choices, the combat, lockpicking, perks, stats, gear, exploring, etc etc.\nIt's also damn amazing that we got a medieval game WITHOUT Tolkien influence.\n\nKingdom Come Deliverance is the best game ever developed and I can't wait until February for KCDII",

I consider a good mix to be one where the flavors of the liquor and mixer blend well together, like Cranberry Juice and Cognac, Rum and Root Beer, White Rum and Pineapple Juice, etc. But with whiskey and cokes, I could always distinguish between the two flavors, so I never got the hype around it. I wrote whiskey off as just not being great for mixed drinks.\n\nUntil last Saturday. A friend at the bar recommended I try Jack and Sprite (and it was my first drink of the night, so no drunk judgements lol) and I was blown away at just how well the whiskey seemed to mesh together with the crisp flavor of the Sprite. I kept sipping the drink, expecting it to get nasty at some point, but it never did.\n\nEarlier tonight, I decided to try the mix at home, to rule out the possibility of the bar pouring light shots into my drink. But sure enough, 2 oz of whiskey mixed with 7 oz of Sprite is just as smooth as it was that night.",

Everyone who experiences this kind of media experiences it in at least a slightly different way from anyone else. You know you've made something like this when many people agree that it's good, but everyone has a different opinion on why it's good. Let's call this layer \"Savory\".\n\n\nThen, you have media that's just fun. What you see is what you get, and it's a good time where you don't have to think too much. There's not a lot of substance, but the execution of the style makes it a pleasant experience. You know you've made this when everyone knows exactly why it's good just from watching it.  Let's call this layer \"Sweet\".\n\n\nAfter that, you have media that's dumb and bad. It's not trying to be smart and isn't claiming to, but also isn't giving the audience what it craves in terms of style. This is most often seen in adaptations of previously known media that doesn't deliver on what made the original good. These are your run-of-the-mill cash grabs that make no attempt to even seem like they care. You know you've made this when people just forget it and move on, or complain that it just didn't give them what they wanted. Let's call this layer \"Bland\".\n\n\nFinally, at the bottom of the barrel, you have media that wants to seem meaningful and like it's saying something, but the commentary it delivers is superficial, on-the-nose, or just flat-out nonsensical. The kind that doesn't speak for itself but the creator insists it does while begging to be asked for an explanation so that it doesn't have to. This is the media that insults its audience the most, and is the most unpleasant to experience, because it actively harms the audience's ability to think about what they're experiencing by forcing them to think but giving them nothing of substance to actually think about. No amount of style will save this kind of media from how blatantly it lies about having substance. You know you've made this when you've pissed off the audience to the point where they question your integrity as an artist. Let's call this layer \"Bitter\". \n\n\nWhat pieces of media come to mind when you hear about each of these layers and what they mean?",

That's why some people don't like receiving gifts; they know they have to pay it back somehow. \n\nThis is a bit more harsh but even having children and sacrificing stuff for them is to ensure that your genetics and bloodline continues. That goal may not be something we actively think about but our inherent instincts doing so.\n\nDonating or giving to charity is to make yourself feel better and to make yourself look good too. When you adopt a stray puppy is it ultimately to help it or yourself? Satisfying ourselves is our number one goal in life and being generous and giving to others supports that. We have been educated since birth what is good and bad thus we try to do the good  to make ourselves be good. Even horrible people genuinely think they're doing the right thing. A bit extreme but say Hitler he didn't think he was evil and a dictator yes he probably liked being powerful but he was probably thinking he was helping Germany and its citizens. \n\nThis is a bad explanation but I think that everyone is 'selfish' in a way and that our perception of good or bad people is just based on how honest they're really being.

These articles are not true because in reality, no one is perfect even the Japanese people but people from other countries don\u2019t care about the meaning of this word in regards to the Japanese people as they\u2019ll keep on saying \u201cJapanese are obsessed with perfectionism or perfection\u201d or \u201cJapanese people are perfectionist\u201d They also don\u2019t know the meaning of the word \u201ckodawari\u201d and people from other countried are confuse as they mean it needs to be perfect as achievable or a goal. But the word kodawari doesn\u2019t really mean it needs to be perfect as achievable or as a goal.

But I've just really never understood the point.\n\nI understand that every school is different, but in my high school it always seemed like school spirit was just a tactic by the administration to distract us from our school's problems. Sure, our school can't go a year without someone killing themselves, but let's focus on the big homecoming game against Smallville instead! I understand why the school wants to create  a strong sense of community, but if you want students to take pride in the school, then actually try to fix the issues instead of sweeping them under the carpet.\n\nEven without taking that into consideration though, it just seems pointless. I don't go to school to go to football games or dances, I go to school to learn. That's it. The whole point of school is that you leave at some point. So why form an emotional connection to a place that you're only going to be in for four years? \n\nCollege is a little different. I understand why people have more connections to college: a) they actually choose to go there, b) they most likely lived on the campus at some point, so it was basically a second home, and c) the friendships you make in college are a lot more stronger than the ones you make in high-school. But it still seems kind of pointless. You go to college to learn skills that will get you your ideal career. If you're just watching football and going to parties, you're in college for all the wrong reasons. \n\nTL;DR - A school is a vehicle for education. That's it. The purpose of school is to meet all the requirements, then move on. There is literally no reason for you to have an emotional attachment to your school. The only people I've met that have school spirit are the people that wish they could say in high school/college forever. And if you feel that way, you've done something very wrong.",

I may be glossing over a couple of other things that people did not like about the app, but the main gripe that many people had was that \"it cost $50\"\n\n I think that this gripe is overblown and even childish. It's a wallpaper app. It's not like Marques (the YouTuber in question) put all of his content behind  a paywall. It's not like he promised a free app and then pull the rug under everyone and announce that it was a paid app at the last minute. This was a random passion project, that was meant to give people high quality wallpapers AND MORE IMPORTANTLY support artists. Half of the proceeds that the app makes goes towards the artists, and that has always been the case for the app, not something that they added in an update.\n\nI just don't see how not downloading this app isn't the easiest way to avoid it. You think the prices are too expensive? Don't download it. Do you think the app was janky and had too many ads? Cool, don't download it. Personally, I wouldn't spend $200 on a Gucci belt, but that doesn't mean I want Gucci to take every belt that they have off their shelves, rework them, and then sell them again so that it meets standards to my liking. Instead, I am comfortable living in a world that has things that are not for me. \n\n",

As a tall person with long legs, this is a huge plus for me. Secondly, it frees up people to recline without hindering the person behind them.\n\nThe only real negative I can see, and I'm happy to be proven wrong, is that it does seem like it would be more claustrophobic for the people on the bottom row. The whole, \"You'll get pink eye every flight\" thing doesn't hold any merit in my eyes. Every picture I've seen of the double deckers has a seat and a solid barrier between the person on top and the person behind them, so it doesn't appear the risk of pink eye would be any higher on this type of plane compared to a regular plane.\n\n",

You can hear the bands progression from a jazz theater group in the early to mid 70s to their transition into New Wave (which started around 76 to 77)",

        "text": "Often I read and hear people say that it is the worst movie ever made. I imagine such judgments are made because it is being compared to The Exorcist, however I feel that, compared to the first movie, I actually prefer the second one.\n\nThe first movie suffers from the same drawbacks as many early 70s movies. The first hour or so is incredibly dull and lifeless. Many of the scenes are unnecessary and the structure is incoherent. \n\nMeanwhile the second movie actually creates a \u201cmythology\u201d surrounding the demon in the first film, gives it an origin in Pazuzu and the African mythology, something that it rarely covered in mainstream Hollywood film. The often ridiculed hypnotism scenes are nowhere near ludicrous as some other scenes seen in other horror movies of the time and even now. If the machine is considered OTT, then really the act of hypnotism in movies as a whole should be considered OTT. It\u2019s just a method they use for the movie to make it more visual.\n\nFinally I think the acting is not that bad. Richard Burton, a personal favourite of mine, is admittedly not at his strongest, which is no doubt due to his drinking, yet he still has presence to carry the film. I think Linda Blair is just as good here as in the first one and Louise Fletcher is good too, as it James Earle Jones (who actually trumps Burton in their scene together).\n\nIs the Exorcist 2 the best movie ever made? Of course it isn\u2019t. Is it the worst? Definitely not. ",

The play-by-play guy actually was only half-bad on this call (he only kinda screamed like a banshee) but the color commentator just yells \"YEAH!\" a bunch of times and you could hear him either falling or knocking shit off his desk. All in all, radio announcers are routinely awful listens and   ruin your experience listening to the game when you have to listen to it on the radio/radio stream. \n\nWhat's worse is that they are extremely good at the actual craft of broadcasting. They often do a remarkable job of painting a picture of what is happening on the field/ice - so you can see the ability is there - but they can't resist acting like blithering fools during a broadcast: yelling, ignoring whenever the opponent does anything well, not admitting they were wrong when replays or rules say they are, saying \"we/us/our\" etc. \n\nOne caveat: this does not apply to New York City or Los Angeles sports teams. Those guys are super professional and while they obviously get MORE excited when the home team succeeds they aren't completely disinterested or dispassionate when the opponent does something well. The further you get away from NYC/LA, the worse it gets. The Tampa Bay Lightning have the worst I have ever heard. I'm surprised they even say the other team's name.\n\nAlso, for extra bonus for those in Seattle: [Bret Musberger's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUK6opejgA8) call of Martinez' double is so much better than [Niehaus'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8SBJzOEcyU)",

Whereas with dubbing, there's always a disconnect between the regular audio and the dubbed audio, the lines feel awkwardly written to conform to the lib sync, and it's almost always done by bad impersonators of the actors (though I think *Pulp Fiction* was done by the movie's actual stars). Muting is better, less awkward, and doesn't compromise the dialogue as badly.\n\nEdit: I'm not saying any kind of editing of profanity is \"the good kind\" (they're both definitely annoying) I'm just saying that one is better.",

In this sense the ethics of a relationship should also include how would be the method in case things go south, because sometimes behaviors in the ending process can throw away all the sense of worth of time and live given. \n\nObviously it can't be applied to all cases, but in general I guess this aspect of human (des)connection is blindsided such death in live as a subject of discussion.\n\nJust look at No Contact as a standard method of what happens after ending and people staying hooked in a lot of illusions with no touch of reality. A lot of unecessary pain. \n\nCommunication, closure, to be avaliable to give answers and to promote respect after a love story should be a quintessential to more healthy relationships and to avoid the majority of people to carry unecessary bagages to the next connection. And this behavior check should be mandatory as a trait check before como together with someone.\n\nAnd I believe that should be more a thing. As far as it can sound strange, sometimes even exes in people lives as friends is a sign that people really get over each other and was able to give them other meanings. It's very common, after all, when we break up, that we have validation that our times were cherish. Helps to move on.

The reason why is because the trends in gaming changed and people hid their true feelings.\n\nFFXIII just was against the trends at of gaming at the time. Let me run down the list\n\n1: The game is Linear, I admit it could have had more to do but Final Fantasy games have always been linear other games just gave you more illusion of choice. I like that this doesn't waste your time with so much walking. This was around the time of games like GTA and Skyrim.\n\n2: It is a very decadent maximalist game. This was when minimalist games with muted color pallets were all the rage. FFXIII is glossy and colorful. It also is very elegant and almost cosmopolitan in it's look contrasted with the hard boiled macho games of it's day. This even shows in the UI. The UI looks a lot like Fruitger Aero which again was starting to be hated at the time but is seeing a comeback in style\n\n3: It takes itself very seriously, this was at the time when millennial irony was starting to get big and games with a laid back I don't care attitude were all the rage. Think games like GTA and Saints Row. I like that the game takes itself seriously and doesn't wink at the audience constantly.",

        "text": "When I hear \u201cStar Wars\u201d I don\u2019t associate it with traditional Disney, I know Disney owns the rights now, but that deal is relatively new. The \u201cStar Wars\u201d franchise has expanded so much I don\u2019t know how fans can even keep up. Furthermore being a Disney fan doesn\u2019t necessarily make you a Star Wars fan and vice versa. \n\nDisney keeps tearing down/ rebuilding attractions to replace them with SW themed rides/attractions. It makes more sense to me to build a whole SW themed park and make as many attractions as they want completely separate from their original park. Then SW fans could be submerged into the SW universe without stumbling back into the regular ol Disney cartoonish nostalgia. \n\nI know it costs billions to complete a build this big but they\u2019re Disney, DISNEY!!! they can afford it, they own practically every channel. The park might be alleviated of such heavy traffic yet they would be gaining revenue from 2 separate parks at that point. Also less heavy traffic leads to a better experience for park goers and may lead to them returning more frequently.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if you like SW or not it just doesn\u2019t make sense to me to mash it all together and tear down classics to make way for a franchise they recently acquired.

        "text": "Many people online are arguring which one are the most important or the best for the culture, society or country to run some people are sided with collectivism and the others individualism. People on both sides think that collectivism and individualism are mutually exclusive. It goes like this for people who sided with collectivism thinks that if collectivism works in the culture the results will be that the country or society have harmony, social cohesion, be clean interdependence and much more but it will hamper creativity, uniqueness, individual thoughts, innovation and much more. On the other hand, people who sided with individidualism thinks that if individidualism works in the culture the country or society will have creativity, high GDP, innovation, high intellegence and much more but it will hamper, social cohesion, it will have conflicts, the country and cities will be dirty, no teamwork and much more.\u00a0\n\nPeople who sided with collectivism and others who sided with individualism are arguring by giving out reasons why they choose their side.\n\nPeople who sided with collectivism against individualism will say:\n\n\u201cCollectivism is better because it\u2019ll make the country and society be clean, have no conflicts, harmony and much more. While individualism is bad because it\u2019ll make the country and society have conflicts, be dirty, no public property, selfishness and much more. That\u2019s why there are countries and cities that are clean, have selfless people and much more because they value collectivism since it\u2019s superior while individualism is bad for the country and society.\u201d\n\nPeople who sided with individualism against collectivism will say:\n\n\u201cScrew that, individualism is better because it\u2019ll make the country and society have creativity, high GDP, innovation, privacy and much more. While collectivism is bad because it\u2019ll make the country and society have no creativity,\u00a0\u00a0low GDP, no innovation, lack of privacy and much more. This is why America especially hollywood and the UK are big at making movies and tv shows because they value individualism which includes creativity. Germany made advanced technologies because individualism is better which includes innovation. While collectivism is bad for the country and society.\u201d\n\nThis argument is getting out of hand and getting so much debate and it needs to stop because in reality, collectivism and individualism are not mutually exclusive they co exist at the same time within all countries and societies and also these two are not the only reasons why there are countries and societies that are clean, creative, innovative, have harmony, high GDP and much more. It goes like this:\n\n1. America is being proclaimed as Individualistic but in scenarios like construction sites and road work, teamwork is required because it needs a lot of people to build and work there which teamwork is a key point of collectivism, so therefore collectivistic culture exist in America. (Personally it\u2019s safe me to say, America is a collectivistic country or society.)\n2. South Korea is being proclaimed as Collectivstic but in scenarios like making technologies, innovation is required because they want to make technologies advanced and innovative which innovation is a key point of Individualism, so therefore individualistic culture exist there in South Korea.\n3. Sweden is also being proclaimed as Individualistic but the country is also clean and it\u2019s either because of different aspect of culture or policies. So therefore, individualism does not automatically mean the country will be dirty which people think that it\u2019ll make the country dirty but it\u2019s untrue.\n4. Japan is also being proclaimed as collectivism but in scenarios like making video games, anime, TV shows and movies, creativity is required because they want to make these things so creative which creativity is a key point of individualism, so therefore individualism culture exist in Japan.\n\nSo these are the countries I point out that you need to understand that collectivism and individualism are not mutually exclusive but they co exist at the same time even in many countries that are proclaimed as collectivistic and other proclaimed as individualistic. You also gotta understand that collectivism and individualism are not the only reasons why countries and societies are clean, have creativity, innovation, people who wants privacy, high GDP and much more.",

Standalone content that gets a sequel (or many sequels) is not diminished because there exists extra content. Hellraiser comes to mind here, as in my opinion the movies get worse as time goes on (enjoyed the most recent one, though), but the first two are still just as excellent as they ever have been. I enjoy sequels, I like to see where the protagonist goes after the fact, or how the world develops post-incident. If there\u2019s an audience for it, it\u2019s justified.\n\nCriticizing remakes in particular because they weren\u2019t \u201cneeded\u201d doesn\u2019t make any sense to me at all. We remake things because we\u2019re inspired by them and want to reimagine them, or because we think it would be interesting to see how it went if it went slightly differently, or if a role was played by someone who wasn\u2019t around for the original. Not every remake is a hit, or even necessarily good, but I\u2019m usually glad they tried or intrigued to see how it goes when I\u2019m walking into the theater.\n\nAnd look, I\u2019m not naive, I\u2019m well aware that money is a massive driving factor behind these films, and that they\u2019re not all artistic passion projects, but money\u2019s a motivation for a lot of original work too. I don\u2019t think they need to be put on a pedestal, but regardless of why they were made, the final product can still be enjoyed, but these films definitely don\u2019t need to be justified, nor should the be criticized for existing just because there wasn\u2019t an overt need for them.",

        "text": "Just to be clear, I don\u2019t mean the least entertaining, or that she is my least favorite character. I mean out of all people on the show, her moral compass is the most askew. \n\nNow, I know lots of people will rush to say Barney or Ted, and while they aren\u2019t great either (and neither is Robin frankly) in my opinion Lily is far worse than any of them due to her self righteousness. What drives me crazy about her is the way she forces her moral standards and views of the world onto everyone else around her and manipulates the people around her for her own selfish desires, while acting like it\u2019s for their own good. \n\nBefore I get into that I\u2019ll discuss the flaws of other characters. \n\nBarney doesn\u2019t pretend to be a good person. He knows very well that he doesn\u2019t treat women how they should be treated and doesn\u2019t try to pretend to be a good person when he isn\u2019t, and it\u2019s something he really seems to wrestle with and grow from throughout the show as he learns to not be afraid of commitment. (Ignore the last two episodes where him and Robin get divorced. \n\nTed has main character syndrome without a doubt. He takes everything that happens to him as a sign from the universe that this girl is the one. When he likes a girl he expects it to be reciprocal and tries on multiple occasions to go out with women under false pretenses in a Barney like way. Except he\u2019s the \u201cnice guy\u201d and the \u201chopeless romantic\u201d which imo makes him worse than Barney because Barney doesn\u2019t pretend to be something he isn\u2019t. \n\nRobin isn\u2019t exactly a cup of tea either. She knows she can\u2019t give the men in her life (except for Barney) the sort of commitment they would be looking for, so she strings them along instead of being alone so that she can fulfill her short term sexual and romantic desires, and dumps this guys as soon as they stop being easy or as soon as they catch onto robins plan. \n\nMarshall is a good dude. I wish he would condemn Lily\u2019s shittiness more, but other than that no problems with the guy. \n\nIn my opinion, all of that pales in comparison to the terribleness of Lily Aldrin. First let us discuss aldrin justice. She views the world as her kindergarten class, and she is the teacher. If someone does something she views as mean, she has the right to take things from them as a form of justice. The amount of self entitlement, self righteousness, and narcissism it takes to see everyone so far below you that you have the right to correct their behavior by taking away their things is absolutely astonishing. \n\nNext, there is how she enforces this view (and others) on the people around her. Ted almost loses his job because Lily stole his bosses ball. She almost caused issues with the captain when she stole his ashtray.\n\nShe also thinks she is the arbiter of relationships in the people around her. She breaks up Ted and his girlfriends over the course of a decade because she doesn\u2019t like how the women would fit into her life. B it she tells herself (and Ted) when it\u2019s for Ted\u2019s own good, when in reality Lily just doesn\u2019t like them. She kidnaps Robin and Barney until they define the terms of their relationship before they are ready. \n\nWhat annoys me the most is how the show presents Lily, as kind and thoughtful. She is a manipulative narcissist and by far the worst character on the show. ",

Those beautifully crafted intros not only set the tone for the show but also build anticipation and immerse us in the world of the story. Whether it\u2019s the haunting melody of Game of Thrones or the nostalgic theme of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, these intros have become a part of the cultural fabric.\n\nHere\u2019s why skipping them is a mistake:\n\n\t1.\tSetting the Mood: Intros create an emotional connection. They prime us for what\u2019s to come, whether it\u2019s excitement, tension, or nostalgia. Skipping them is like diving into a movie without the opening credits\u2014it feels incomplete.\n\t2.\tCultural Significance: Some intros become iconic in their own right, spawning memes, remixes, and fan art. By skipping them, we miss out on a shared cultural experience that brings fans together.\n\t3.\tCharacter Development: Many intros give us visual cues about character arcs and themes that might not be fully explored in the episode. Skipping them means losing out on those important nuances that enhance our understanding of the story.\n\t4.\tLoss of Ritual: For many of us, the ritual of watching a show includes enjoying the intro. It\u2019s a moment to settle in, grab snacks, and mentally prepare for the episode. Rushing past it feels like we\u2019re in a hurry to finish instead of savoring the experience.\n\t5.\tIt\u2019s a Choice: I get that some people want to binge-watch and maximize their time, but isn\u2019t part of the joy of watching TV to enjoy the journey, not just the destination?\n\nSo, next time you\u2019re tempted to hit that \u201cskip intro\u201d button, consider what you might be missing.

In recent years it seems all of my social media bubble is into \"traveling\", which is according to \"travelers\", very different from tourism.

Collecting flags of places they have been to in their bio is also often a thing (gotta catch them all i guess? and with them i mean economy flights). How is this different from being a tourist? Also: \"i enjoy eating and buying and being in beautiful places\", big deal?? how are these things considered hobbies. Hobbies should be related to a specific interest, and to my understanding have an element of practice to them, of improvement over time and possibly even of skill. Unless all these people throughly enjoy *all* the cultures in the world to the point that they make an effort to learn languages, research history, try to meet locals in every trip.. you know the actually interest-related, skillful aspect of traveling... i feel like we just fell for yet another trap of capitalism in disguise: consume, show off, repeat. The amount of \"travelers\" I met who dont even know their own hometowns or neighbouring areas.. suggests to me that genuine curiosity or \"wonderlust\" (ugh) is not really a motive as much as a full wallet combined with boredom and the need to show off. \n\ntldr: Traveling is a L hobby imo.",

It made my shaving time go from 10 minutes to 1 hour minimum, I had to \u201cprepare\u201d my face with hot water towel for 5-10 minutes so that I don\u2019t get irritations , then during the shaving process I had to be extra careful so that I don\u2019t cut myself and it meant more time and slower progress.\n\n4. I couldn\u2019t shave my until 5 days later , this is due to irritation and the neck area specifically gets very sensitive 1-2 days after shaving .\n\n\nNow what I did was pretty much buy a quality modern 3 razor blade razor (80$) and came with 8 razor heads .\n\nMy time to shave went back to 10 minutes, now shaving is easier , better and I can honestly say the modern razor does not irritate my face while still providing a close to edge shave , something that was lacking in the double edged razor .\n\nI also shave weekly with no \u201cfear\u201d of cuts or insane amounts of preparations.\n\n\nI\u2019m putting this because don\u2019t believe everything you see on the internet, regardless how much \u201cauthentic\u201d it seems \n\nTLDR : Tried the double-edged razor hype for 3 months\u2014constant cuts, stubble, and hour-long shaves.

I usually love covers and seeing what other artists do with a concept, but one exception that irks me is the Pentatonix cover of Fleet Foxes White Winter Hymnal. Originally, it was a deep song about innocence and isolation, rooted with folk tones where the singer speaks from the heart; imagery of coldness and snow creating a sort of eeriness. Then Pentatonix makes a vastly over-produced version that has turned the song into a clapping game, like the Cup Song by Anna Kendrick. I will give them credit because they are great singers and can tell they are hitting the harmonies, but I think them choosing to cover that song in this way (overtaking Fleet Foxes in popularity) really removed the soul from it and damaged the meaning of the song to the public eye.",

I could tell that Cynthia Erivo was covered in makeup. Now obviously she's going to be, she's green, but that's not what I mean. Elphaba was treated poorly by her father and she's only allowed to go to Shiz under the pretense that she's helping her sister. Her dress at the beginning of the film is covering her whole body (from her feet to a turtleneck and long sleeves) to try and hide her green-ness as much as possible. She is the only person like her in the existence of Oz. Where did she get makeup that matched her skin tone? No way her father would have gotten it for her if it existed. \n\nI'm over thinking this aren't I?",

The scene where the priest starts licking the guy\u2019s head after killing him was a really disturbing and excellent scene and it was unfortunately the last of its kind from that point on. \n\nOnce vampires are introduced it really nosedives in quality. Not in just the silly plot twist but in the writing. The introduction of vampires really ruined the first half for me. Like I thought the show was going a way that was truly original and well done and then it goes \u201clol jk it\u2019s vampires\u201d and it drops all subtly in its criticism of religion. And even the commentary on religion is just inconsistent and almost playing favorites. The Chr1st1an organization is depicted as corrupt, manipulative, and evil but for some reason 1slam gets a pass? The mus1im sheriff is a hero who tries to save everyone and at no point questions his own faith. His son leaves 1slam and because of it he ends up dying but not before converting back to 1slam. Like how are you going to have a show that is a blatant critique on religion but not criticize one of the most oppressive religions and instead depict it in a very positive light? In fact it isn\u2019t \u201calmost playing favorites\u201d it is playing favorites. \n\nIt\u2019s been a while since I saw the show but I also remember the group of heroes at the end also behaving in really dumb ways that would have got them caught by the towns folk in any competently written story.

        "text": "I often hear people say that they don't like running because they find it boring, and that they'd rather do other forms of cardio.\n\nPersonally, I never really understood how that could be the case. I just finished a tough interval training session on the track a few days ago, and I was anything but bored. My legs were burning, I was gasping hard, and it took a great degree of mental effort to finish the whole workout. The post-workout euphoria was great. If I had to describe that workout, I would say it was challenging and rewarding. Definitely not boring.\n\nI also don't find longer, slower paced runs boring, as they give me a good opportunity to organise my thoughts, reflect on past events, and process things that have happened to me recently. In today's society, people are almost constantly scrolling on their phones, and most rarely get the opportunity to simply sit in silence with their thoughts. A long, easy run gives me the chance to do just that, while providing health and fitness benefits at the same time.\n\nWhat I like about running is how convenient it is. You don't need to buy a bike, you don't need to travel to a location that has a pool, all you need are a pair of shoes and you're ready to go. You also don't need to master any complicated skills; most people can run with passable form. You can easily adjust the intensity of your workout. Want something light? Just jog slowly. Want to go harder? You can easily push yourself to your absolute limit with some interval sprints.  To me, running is simply the best form of cardio because of how accessible, versatile, and effective it is. ",

        "text": "I even like some live-action adaptations, but animation is the best format to adapt anything related to comics, games, literary sagas, etc. Here are my arguments:\n\n1. Live-action tends to become outdated quickly because depending on when you watch it, the effects might have already aged. Even some of today's live-actions suffer a bit from cheap CGI, and with the amount of money spent, they could have made an animation that, even if simple, would still be great.\n2. Animations can make characters extremely faithful to the original works they are based on. I find it really strange, for example, to watch *The Last of Us* and see characters that don\u2019t resemble those from the game. While people might love that series, I don't enjoy it as much. But aside from that, which is considered good, the best video game adaptations have been done in animation.\n3. Cartoons never age. Look at the upcoming *Harry Potter* series, for example. They're looking for a 10-year-old actor to match the first book. However, a season of a series takes much longer to produce than a movie (considering a cinematic budget). So at some point, we'll find it odd that the actor's age doesn't match the character, like what happened with *Stranger Things* (even though that show wasn't based on anything).\n4. Live-actions are limited. As good as CGI effects can be nowadays, nothing beats the creative freedom and infinite possibilities that animation offers.\n\nAll that being said, I wish many of today's projects were done in animation. I would love it if the MCU movies were animated. Imagine being able to make the characters look exactly like they do in the comics without coming across as awkward, like in some films. Imagine how amazing the Dungeons & Dragons movie would be if it were animated. Or a fully animated series based on the Harry Potter books. I get the commercial side of it, I believe live-actions attract more viewers. But if we consider quality alone, animation is superior in every way, and I don\u2019t understand why people get hyped when something is announced as a live-action adaptation (especially of games). Hollywood has managed to implant this live-action culture, and now people will accept any awkward as long as it's packed with CGI. And I'll go further, maybe my most unpopular opinion of all: as much as I like *The Lord of the Rings* movies, I would love to see an adaptation of the books completely redone in animation.",

Making it function the way it does would have been harder than just making it in a way we already know is fun, and it's not like the variety the guns (are supposed to) have would needed any of that to be reworked. \n\nThe entire game feels like it wasn't built for its own mechanics, it's a mish-mash of ideas that are fun in isolation but somehow they have built in every contradiction there is to make those mechanics as unenjoyable as possible. \n\nIt isn't a good game, my time with it is some of the least fun I have ever had in my life, and I genuinely do not understand how it got released at all, let alone how it got a sequel (no hate to BL2 tho, I quite liked it).

Here is a list of franchises where the original is arguably  not the best.\n\n\u2022 Top Gun\n\n\u2022 Star Wars\n\n\u2022 Evil Dead\n\n\u2022 Terminator\n\n\u2022 Lord of the Rings(although arguably  shouldn\u2019t count)\n\n\u2022 Dark Knight\n\n\u2022 Godfather\n\n\u2022 Toy Story\n\n\u2022 Star Trek\n\n\u2022 literally every Marvel hero except for Iron Man and Guardians of the Galaxy \n\nAbout half of these films didn\u2019t even have sequels that were planned. However if a movie had enjoyable enough characters and a cool universe, it\u2019s not that much of a stretch to believe that worthy sequel can be made. \n\n\nI think people have gotten sick of the sequel overload that has come out of Hollywood in the past 10 years. That\u2019s a very fair statement, that I agree with. However, that\u2019s also very different from saying sequels suck.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m crossing out Lord of the Rings, probably shouldn\u2019t count. However, I\u2019m adding 4 more franchises \n\nShrek: Shrek 3 and 4 aren\u2019t great, but 2 is arguably better than 1\n\nMission Impossible: the first one is probably considered to be like the 5th best in the franchise.\n\nFast and Furious:  not super familiar with their films, but most seem to rank the first one in somewhere near the middle or even bottom.\n\nBourne: Supremacy and Ultimatum are both better.\n\n\nIf y\u2019all are arguing the original is almost never the worst then fair point, but it doesn\u2019t negate that sequels don\u2019t always suck ",

For the first two minutes, I thought it was pretty good. Such dark lyrics, and a great guitar riff.\n\nUnfortunately, my excitement went away when it got to the \"Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?\" part. I don't remember how I reacted to it, but it really took me out of the song. When the song finally ended, I got confused. Is 'Bohemian Rhapsody' one song? Or three songs? And why did the tone change all of a sudden?\n\nAfter I finished, I never listened to it again. I would hear the song on occasions whether I'd be in an area where music is played on the speakers, or whenever one of my school teachers would play music. As I grew older, I began to not hate it as much, but when I would listen to the song, I would only play the ballad part.\n\nIt's now 2024, and I still only listen to the ballad part (+ the ending \"nothing really matters\" lyrics. 'Cause why not). Funny enough, I've listened to fan-edited versions of the song on YouTube (where it's just the ballad) more than the actual official upload.\n\nBefore anyone comes up with any conclusions, let me settle the deal. Just because I'm not a fan of 'Bohemian Rhapsody'. that doesn't mean I don't like 'Queen'. In fact, one of my favorite songs of all time is a Queen song (It's A Kind Of Magic). I just think that their most popular song is weirdly structured, changes tone too quickly, and it's quite bizarre. This is where I give my props to Queen, as for their Live Aid performance, they only played the ballad. Although, I have to assume that they didn't play the rest of the song because of the time-limit each performer of the concert had.\n\nStrangely, however. I did eventually find the second half of the song to be slightly better when it's performed live. I'm not a fan of the original studio version, but I did find myself like the second half more in life performances, and i guess it's because it feels more like a transition to song, and it has more fan interaction.\n\nAnyways, that is my unpopular opinion.",

The fact that the MCU is so afraid to show any actual emotion or remorse and has to pull its punches with a joke every ten seconds did both of these story lines a disservice and Taika Waititi deserved a movie more geared towards his brand of comedy instead of being forced to turn what should be one of the most devastating and heartfelt MCU movies into a screwball comedy.

People act like this man is a serial killer because he can't draw feet. I actually think his infamous captain america drawing is AMAZING, and I'm damn sure it's better than anything I've seen from frank miller.

Nobody told them why it's important in terms they understand, so they feel it's busy work and that's just not fun. So slowly they start to not care until they're forced to care or be retained.\n\nSometimes it's the teachers, or parents, or students. Sometimes it's all three. But the point is that people like success, and dislike failure. Math is one of those subjects where if you didn't do well one year, odds are you aren't going to be good at it next year since each subsequent year depends a lot on the developed skills of the previous year.\n\nIt's a slippery slope. One bad year will lead to a decade of frustration. And almost everyone has a difficult time at one point or another. The problem is other people /mostly teachers/ simply leave them where they are.",

(Even if they saved the extra $5 a week a ticket would cost) \nKnowing the odds and understanding that it will in 99.99999 percent of the time not pay for itself doesn\u2019t take into account the fact that the thought and hope of a chance at a completely different lifestyle can drastically improve someone\u2019s life.\n\n$5 dollars a week helps me get through 60 hours of work, gives me wonderful things to daydream about, helps me enjoy watching content about cars I will never be able to afford, and gives me 2 times a week during the draw something to get excited about. That\u2019s a better investment than 99% of things I would spend that $5 on otherwise.\n\nFor People that don\u2019t feel this way it\u2019s fine, but for those that do. It is a very worthwhile investment.\n\n\nEdit: A couple of notes.\nThis was apparently indeed an unpopular opinion.\n\n1. A lot of people seem to have a problem with the word \u201cinvestment\u201d as for them this is aways means a financial investment with positive expected financial returns. I understand this and should have possibly used another word. but as the very first sentence says I have no EXPECTATIONS of positive financial returns. \n\n2. Lottery also seems to have multiple different meanings. Where I am from the lottery is the euro jackpot, twice weekly drawn, \u20ac10 million- 120\u20ac million ball lottery. Each ticket cost 2\u20ac. I have never bought scratch it cards, or similar.\n\n3. I am talking about people in a financial secure position that can SPARE $5. I work hard, save well, invest a much larger portion of my income than $20 a month. But instead of a Big Mac, or brand name shoes, I buy $5 worth of tickets. If you can\u2019t afford $5 a week on \u201cluxury items\u201d then don\u2019t buy a ticket.\n\n4. Finally. Maybe I should not of used the word \u201chope\u201d either. I love my life as is and as I said I am financially in a decent place and well on my way to a comfortable life and even slightly earlier retirement. Even if I saved that $5 a week and invested it I would see a difference of about  $20,000 by the time I\u2019m 65. This isn\u2019t an insignificant amount of money, but for me personally it probably won\u2019t change the last 15ish years of my life that much. \n$50,000,000 would however change my life dramatically, and for longer than 15ish years ",

In this end, it\u2019s just a continuation of high school cliques when people should actually be much more integrated into the university itself.\n\nSecond, the idea of rushing/pledging is a dumb ritual to create the veneer of exclusivity and merit, when really it\u2019s just a form of unnecessary hazing. It also generates a culture of elitism that has no place in society and does a poor job preparing anyone for the real world after college.\n\nThird, the bad rep they tend to have on campus just confirms how little the university as a whole benefits from these. Not only do \u201cfrat houses\u201d actually take away property from actual folks living in the community near the university, but they\u2019re generally disruptive and a safety hazard most weekends due to excessive partying.\n\n",

Those same people might even decry the thought of taking on the responsibility of parenthood, and oftentimes use that effort they put into making money for someone else as a reason why not to have kids. \n\nLike I've heard about students putting in massive hours and again, sleepless nights for months on end. If you're a medical student it'll likely be years before you are stable. If you're in the trades you could get permanently injured or have no time for yourself. If you get a high degree you might not have a much money as others in your age group due to student loan debt. If you're in a field that involves caringfor others then a mistake could cost someone else dearly or you might not even be situated for the work and now that effort you put in is fundamentally wasted. You then work until either you die early or can save enough to retire all old and less invigorated than when you were younger.  \n\nAsk them about kids though and those exact same reasons become the very reasons why they won't have any, lack of time,  the commitment for years, the sleepless nights, the short on money, maybe you won't be happy, maybe you'll make a mistake... these are all somwhow unacceptable sacrifices for kids but when it comes to fattening your employer's wallet everyone wants to fall all over themselves biting for that carrot.

This is a lose-lose situation for everyone.\n\nThe problem is that the only path forward for many careers is management. For example, the best teachers end up becoming principals because being a principal pays more, but it doesn\u2019t have to be that way. \n\nIn the tech industry there are senior positions for individual contributors such as \u201cdistinguished engineer\u201d who get paid like managers but don\u2019t have to manage anyone, they can focus on doing a good job at their work. This should be the case for all industries like education, where the potential impact of a great teacher can be vast, especially if given the right tools to teach more kids. \n\n\n\n",

If someone can make anonymous complaints to try & get people in trouble, employees should be allowed to protect some of their privacy.\n\nETA: Thank you for all your responses!

I cannot stress this enough when I say that it is a fantastic thing to do and working on public speaking is a great thing to practice. However, if your version of comedy is talking to people who are offstage and then asking them more and more questions which then you laugh at, and then the audience laughs at you are not a comedian, you are talking to somebody. \n\nI went to Gabriel Iglesias\u2019s show, as well as Tom Segura. Two professional comedians then I went to about three TikTokers comedy show and was very disappointed at most of their jokes. Lot of them were small jokes, which then let up to an interview with the audience and then asking questions. \n\n\u201cdoes anybody here do this? how many people do this?\u201d THAT IS NOT A JOKE. It can however, I will admit, lead to a joke. But if you are going in hoping that somebody has an odd job, that you can make quick simple, bounceable  jokes you are not a comedian. I understand the comedy is a subjective thing and not one person could have the best humor and maybe their thing is talking to somebody off stage but then you\u2019re not really a comedian I mean I\u2019m sorry, but that\u2019s just my opinion.\n\nEdit: Perhaps I should rephrase, my point is that if you are trying to be a comedian, and the jokes/laughter you get from the audience is the important part of your routine, that means that to an extent the person on the stage can be swapped out for someone else. Your routine should have some kind of monologue and punchline not working off of someone else\u2019s life experience unless you were there aswell",

I agree with many of the commenters here who have said that thoughtful cards are more than enough.\n2) Money is a great gift, always. It\u2019s one way of showing support for either what\u2019s needed or wanted without judgment or pretense.\n3) Don\u2019t know what to buy someone? Anxious about getting it wrong? Write a note, give a gift card or cash, or simply have the courage to ask them what they\u2019d like. \n4) So many people saying that I\u2019m ungrateful or lack compassion, or suggesting that I\u2019m hoity-toity\u2014if you read my post carefully you\u2019d have noticed I didn\u2019t say that gifts must/should be given.

There\u2019s no reason to be rude or harsh toward someone. However, there\u2019s this secret shame that comes with this: of not liking the gift, of feeling like a bad person for not wanting it, etc. This is inherently unfair and makes gift-giving about the gifter and not the recipient. \n6) Not to mention having to now regift, donate, or throw something away. And then being asked about the gift later and then having to lie to appease these folks\u2019 egos. ",

It is taken way too seriously for a game where you drive little cars and drink beer with your friends. People need you to be silent when they're playing or else they'll blame you for poor play. The outfits are over-kill. Who needs to wear khakis and a polo for a \"sport\"? Country clubs are notoriously pretentious and snooty. It often costs wayyyy too much. People who play constantly talk about their own game. To me, it's like fantasy football. It could be fun for the person playing but no one wants to hear what you're shooting on the course. \n\nI could go on but the fact that the sport is this popular is beyond me!",

She would come up to you, ask you what you thought of some other coworker who may have a mildly annoying habit quality, and if you don't say anything negative she would then lightly mention the trait that was mildly annoying. If you just agree that yes, that one trait is annoying, she would go to more coworkers and say that it was YOU who couldn't stand the coworker with a mildly annoying habit. It escalated until she was saying everyone doesn't like this person or that person. She did crap like that throughout the office. She was always looking for something new to criticize and it was her entertainment. Oh, and she had a PhD in bioinformatics so it wasn't a case of someone being poorly educated.\n\nSome people absolutely enjoy criticizing others, which is why celebrity tabloids have not gone bankrupt after all these years.

The thing is, most people label automation itself as the bad guy. Automation in general is a good thing. As humanity evolves, we have eliminated outdated jobs. In the past, plow animals and tools replaced humans, and machinery replaced plow animals. As technology evolves, human lives should get simpler and easier.\n\nThe issue is that our societies rely on jobs. We are not prepared for low entry jobs to be eliminated, as thousands of people will not have the means to earn the needs of life. Instead of allowing lives to continue to get simpler, and working hours continue to shrink, we've expected people to continue working the same amount even though the workload is lessened. \n\nThis is also shown in the WFH movement. Once WFH was made more popular, there were people working 3+ jobs at the same time due to the workload really only needing a few hours from them. In today's society you need someone to pay for hours of your life, not just for a task to be completed. The more things that come out that reduce the amount of hours needed should be seen as a good thing, but without any safety nets in place, it does more harm than good for the working class.",

        "text": "I'm tired of seeing people making fun of others just because they \"peaked\" in high school. You can peak in high school and still not be a loser in the adult world. I'm sorry some of you out there had a shit time in high school, I know teenagers can be mean, but just because you had a shit time doesn't mean everyone else has to feel bad about having a great time in their teenage years. I peaked in high school and I'm not afraid to say it. I have a great and steady career in a job I enjoy, I'm saving for a house, I have investments and savings, I have friends and family that I am close to and see regularly, I have hobbies that keep me happy and fulfilled in off work hours. But do you know what was way more fun?  Being in high school.\n\nI have to pay rent as an adult, I have to pay bills, I have to go grocery shopping, I have to cook meals on my own. You know when I didn't have to do any of that shit? When I was in high school. I worked so I could have money to buy a beat up car, gas, some beer/weed money but that was much less hours than the 40 I work now and I didn't have to commute for an hour everyday to clock in at Wendy's. And you know what the worst that would happen if I hated my job and I told the manager at wendys to fuck off? I just go home and look if McDonalds has any openings. If I told my manager to fuck off these days I have to explain to potential new employers why I left my last job and hope they don't call my old company to ask and if I don't find a new job in time I lose my car, my apartment, my savings, and my dignity.\n\nYou know what else you can do in high school that you can't as an adult? Slack off on your \"day job\". In school you just have to be there and you can stare at the wall and give half assed answers if you don't feel like participating that day. Yeah you have to complete homework, and quizzes, and tests but I knew some real dumb motherfuckers who put in zero effort and the school bends over backwards to get them graduated and out the door. In the real world if I stare at the wall all day and give half assed responses to my bosses questions I get reprimanded and possibly fired.\n\nYeah having to live under your parents rules can suck but sneaking around those rules and slipping out to smoke a doobie with your friends is an exhilarating experience you cant replicate just sitting on the couch in your apartment. All of your friends are also nearby in the same city so you don't have to plan get togethers a week in advance because you all live spaced out from each other. Not to mention you probably cant even all get together with a weeks notice because you all now have jobs and family and responsibilities. In high school you can just text the group chat and all meet up within 30 minutes.\n\nYou also get organized sports in high school. I was a multi sport varsity athlete and it was fucking awesome. You get your name in the paper, people praise you just because you can throw a ball well, our biggest football games against the cross town rival had crowds of 20,000 people to watch you play a game and they all cheer you on when you do something good. These days if I bragged about the hat trick I scored in men's league the night before no one would care and at work if I nail my quarterly report I get a \"good job\" from the boss and then its on to the next task.\n\nI'm not debating there are parts of adulthood that are better but I had way more fun on a daily basis in high school than I do as an adult toiling away at a desk for 40 hours a week looking forward to the 3 days of vacation I can finally take in a few months when I save up enough PTO (if my boss approves it). So I'm sorry some of you had a bad experience in high school but that doesn't mean you have to be bitter and make fun of others who may have had the best time of their lives.\n\nEdit: ok I get it people I had a different definition of peak than you do you don\u2019t need to be the 174th person to point it out",

It doesn't mean you should be constantly hashing out why the other person has upset you, how you both need to change, why you've disappointed them, why they've disappointed you, what you mean to each other, where things are going, etc. Those conversations rarely help and turn into another way of people manipulating each other during bad relationships. \n\nIf the whole relationship feels like work, you're probably with the wrong person.",

Yes, it's definitely sweet of somebody to get into the office in the morning and announce that they brought bagels or doughnuts; but if I've already eaten breakfast, then either I don't get to partake (which has the added risk of offending whomever brought the food), or I over-consume calories that morning. Or maybe they surprise the office with pizza for lunch. Always a good choice, except if I brought my lunch that day and it won't keep another day, then either food gets wasted or, again, we over-eat. Speaking of over-eating - if somebody is on a fitness journey and only gets one cheat-meal this week, it would be unfortunate if they used that up prior to learning pizza was being provided.\n\nSurprise meals provided at work are certainly done with good intentions, but it can add annoyance or frustration to those who have made their own meal arrangements because they were not aware the food was coming.\n\n  \nEdit: a common theme in the comments is that I simply don't have to partake. The nature of my post stems from the fact that I actually have received soft reprimands for not partaking. Even if I stand with the group without eating the food (so that I'm still there, socially speaking), I still receive that reprimand.\n\nAnother common theme is that I am bringing negativity to the workplace. Let me assure you all that I am NOT expressing any of my opinions in the workplace. I am silent. I over-eat when the pressure compels me to do so, and I dodge eating when it appears I can get away with it. I have not insisted more than anybody else that I was not hungry, and there has been zero attitude. Yes, I'll try to say I'm not hungry, but then comes the soft reprimand that I should eat the food in solidarity with my coworkers, and that's when I get faced with a choice. In those situations, I usually elicit a cheap joke, which garners some chuckles, and then eat the food being offered. ",

Our sentiment and hard work has become a game for such companies now.\n\nMany interviewers and people in jobs, what I've personally seen people do all day is justify that they work, and adapt this overly sensitive and fake attitude amongst their peers. Their behaviour and language sometimes actually feels like Chat GPT under human flesh. \n\nI highly respect and love people who are realistic and honest with their personalities, and are clear and concise. E.g., telling someone \"This time you messed up but next time do better\" rather than \"on this occasion your actions were not in line with our company's expectations\" etc etc. \n\nAlso, I feel LinkedIn becomes more and more fake everyday, where people seek to portray a false personality of themselves - \"I am beyond thrilled and excited to embark on this new adventure in my aim to assist new possibilities blah blah blah\".\n\nI personally feel the real work culture should be back.

        "text": "There\u2019s way too much discourse behind why music sucks in modern times due to attention spans, new technology, and social media. The real problem isn\u2019t that good music doesn\u2019t exist or that artists today are worse than the 90s or before. The problem is that music companies don\u2019t have full control of the landscape anymore. We have more and more independent artists now and a person can\u2019t just turn on a radio and hearing the exact same music everyone else is listening to with nothing else to compare to. Now everyone has their own playlist catering to their own interests. I have a feeling that those who aren\u2019t listening to good music just don\u2019t want to take the time to find it in this new landscape. So many projects that I love get treated as if they must suck because they\u2019re not on the charts. Too many adults have chart addiction and need to start organically looking for artists and albums they like on a personal level. ",

When your passion becomes tied to deadlines, financial pressures, and external expectations, it can deform and corrupt the original love you had for it.\n\nMoreover, the idea of having a \"dream job\" is largely a romanticized, Western concept. It stems from a culture that places immense value on individual fulfillment through work. The notion that we should all find one passion overshadows the reality that most people have multiple interests and skills, not just one singular calling. Forcing these passions into the confines of a job can diminish their value, turning something you once loved into just another task on your to-do list.

        "text": "A sentiment I commonly see when strangers behaving poorly in public is complained about is that you should be expected to confront them first to ask them to stop politely. I've even commonly seen people ridiculed for failing to do so and mocked for not speaking up or for reporting them to an authority (not necessarily police) without ever engaging them directly.\n\n\nI'm talking about situations where someone complains about someone doing something like playing loud music at night, not picking up after their dogs, casually blocking a high traffic path with a shopping cart, taking up too much public seating when little is available, etc.\n\nA specific example that comes to mind is how many people I've talked to seem think I was immature for reporting my apartment neighbor to my apartment management for playing loud bass heavy music after midnight that was shaking my walls. Apparently, I should have knocked and asked them to stop first. I don't disagree that this is a good step to take. I just don't think that it should be an expectation.\n\nI'm of the opinion that people shouldn't have to do this. We shouldn't be expected to confront people as a default. People shouldn't have to be asked to not be a nuisance in public. They should just not be a nuisance to begin with. My desire to not have to confront someone who engages in inconsiderate behavior is higher than my desire to rid myself of a minor nuisance. Having to instruct a stranger on proper public etiquette is often more annoying than than that etiquette being violated.\n\nPeople are not entitled to the opportunity to have strangers around them monitor their behavior to guide them to behave acceptably. They should conduct their manners appropriately on their own.\n\nI have literally never had to have someone ask me to stop being a nuisance. Because I am considerate and pay attention to how my behavior is affecting my surroundings. Why afford inconsiderate people the privilege of hand holding them on public etiquette?\n\nPay attention to how your behavior is affecting those around you. Its not other people's job to do that for you. You don't get points for being apologetic and stopping AFTER being confronted. Too many people just do whatever the hell they want expecting other people to let them know when they've crossed a line. They are always exude an obnoxious confidence and don't spend any mental energy preemptively being considerate.\n\nBeing considerate isn't passive. Its active. You have to think about it and pay attention. If you aren't ACTIVELY being considerate in public then you are being inconsiderate, and there is no way you aren't bothering people around you constantly while being blissfully unaware.",

Those loans then create interest which goes back partly to the universities and partly to governments, like a cunning tax scheme. Also, as a higher % of kids go to university, there are fewer of the very smart kids and the cohort becomes steadily more average. That means that the courses get steadily dumbed down until students learn less complex things than they would have say 20, 30, 40 years ago. So they pay more for way less, while the government and the education sector soaks up the money and keeps expanding. Until hopefully one day - POP!!!",

I do think that tends to be true and common enough, except that it\u2019s actually appropriate as we grow older but our concept of friendship has not matured with us. And it\u2019s a call for us to be intentional about developing and keeping friendships\n\nIn younger years, friendships are often due to proximity and availability. This means we get a lot of time to spend with people, from a schedule that other people plans, and bond over shared experiences (being in school, mainly), as opposed to shared values. It doesn\u2019t require a lot of intentionality or effort to keep friendships. And complacency is actually rewarded. (Avoidance of conflict, being \u201cjust there\u201d, etc.)\n\nWhen we grow into adulthood and have more responsibilities plus distance, we actually need to focus on making time for connections, and be more intentional about what we seek to give and receive from others. We also need to learn to make do when life circumstances, ours or others, require time apart. That also means we get to learn the importance of being well when we\u2019re alone.\n\nSo I do believe it is more difficult to make friends as adult, especially if we tend toward low effort with people, but learning to navigate it in a more difficult setting is supposed to be one of the things that help us become more well rounded over time.",

You can go on just fine with the rest of your life, be happy and still feel like whatever this person did to you wasn't ok and that they're not worthy of your forgiveness. You'll definitely be able to find peace, because you're standing up for yourself. \n\nI was trying really hard to forgive someone I used to be friends with, who wrongfully accused me of something terrible (although they never really asked for forgiveness) because I thought forgiving was the *right* thing to do and in the past it has always come naturally to me -- but this time I realized, I didn't want to forgive them because I just wasn't ok with them betraying my trust and disrespecting me. And accepting that I can't force myself to forgive someone when I authentically don't feel like it, has brought me peace :)",

        "text": "The first Gen Viper was relatively more affordable and a more radical departure from daily driver performance than previous factory hot rods. \n\nLet me 'splain. \n\nWhat was the average person driving in 1995? A fwd econobox with ~150-220 horsepower, a 4-speed auto, 205 or 215 series 16\" tires, airbags, abs, collapsible steering wheel, shoulder belts, etc- slow, safe, and predictable. \n\nThe best selling car in 1995 was the Taurus- dead center on all those stats. \n\n1995 Viper? 400 horsepower, RWD, 6-speed manual, summer compound 275/40R17 front / 335/35R17 rear tires, no abs, no traction control, etc. \n\nThe Viper cost ~1.35 times the average MSRP of a new car in 1985.\n\nNow, let's look at the apex of factory hot rods at the apex of the 1960s horsepower war- the 1969 ZL-1 Corvette. \n\nWhile there was a much larger range of engine (and therefore horsepower) options in 1969, the average car in 1969 had lap belts and no other safety features, a 6 or 8 cylinder with 150-225 horsepower, 205-215 width 14 or 15\" tires, and a 3 speed auto or 3-4 speed manual. \n\n1969 ZL-1 'Vette? ~450 horsepower, lap belts and nothing else, 225 width 15\" tires, and a 4 speed manual. \n\nThe ZL-1 cost ~1.75 times the average MSRP of a new car in 1969. \n\nNow, sure, there's a lot of variability here, but the basics are obvious: while both the Viper and the ZL-1 (or GT500, or Hemi 'Cuda, or COPO Camaro) roughly double the horsepower of the average family car in their day, the Viper has far fewer safety measures, a far greater performance envelope, and is far more affordable to the average dentist than a late '60s supercar. \n\nIf you bolted the ZL-1's polyglas Goodyears onto a 1969 SS350 Camaro it wouldn't really change the look or performance. \n\nPut 275ZR17 summer tires on a '95 Taurus and see what happens. \n\nIn conclusion: if you stepped from a 383 RoadRunner (300 or so hp) into a ZL-1 (~475 hp) in 1969 you spent more money and generated more tire smoke, but your performance and handling weren't radically different and you already expected your daily driver to try to kill you.\n\nIf you stepped from a 1995 Supra (with 300 hp) into a Viper you got a car that was radically more capable with far fewer electronic nannies. \n\nBecause the Viper was (comparably) much more affordable to the average buyer in 1995, more realistically you were stepping from a ~250 hp Camaro, Porsche, or BMW with ABS and traction control into a 400 hp Viper with none of those things. \n\nSo, like I said, the Viper was purchased and driven by people with the wrong expectations in a way late 60's monsters weren't.

If I\u2019m not mistaken, French TV limits ad time to 12 minutes maximum per hour, with an average of 6-9 minutes.

The CFL, while cherished by some, faces declining viewership, financial instability, archaic rules dating back to the 1800s and a limited talent pool compared to the NFL. By introducing NFL teams into Canada, fans would gain access to the highest caliber of competition, uniting North America under a single football standard.\n\nThis shift would also stimulate the growth of high school and college football in Canada, which has largely stagnated. With the NFL's presence, more resources, visibility, and opportunities would be available to young Canadian athletes. This would lead to increased participation and development at the grassroots level, creating a stronger pipeline for future talent.\n\nFurthermore, an NFL expansion into Canada would spark thrilling new rivalries, like Vancouver versus Seattle or Toronto against Buffalo, energizing fan bases and regional pride. For fans, an NFL presence would offer a more consistent and familiar product, drawing larger crowds and sponsorships. Tradition is important, but the future of football in Canada lies in unifying with the NFL to ensure long-term growth, competitiveness, and international appeal.",

A lot of people seem to treat this as if it's a normal thing - but before smartphones, I had never seen any camera save photos mirrored.  You'd have to manually flip it if you wanted it to appear that way.\n\nSmartphone camera software these days often save selfie photos flipped horizontally, like you're looking in a mirror.  I've never understood why they do this, or why any of the phone developers thought this would be a good idea.  People share selfies on social media fairly often, and often, it's obvious that they're mirrored, because text is backwards, etc..  IMO it looks a bit weird.  I've even seen at least one where the person posting said something like \"check out my shirt\", and the text was mirrored..  They could have made it a bit easier to read by sharing a non-mirrored photo.  Even if there isn't any text or obvious signs, I think a photo being shared should basically represent reality.  I wouldn't want to share photos that would make someone appear right-handed when they're actually left-handed, or if I'm sitting in my car, I wouldn't want to make it look like my car is right-hand drive when it's actually left-hand drive, etc..\n\nSmartphone camera software often has an option to disable saving this way (and I do have mine disabled), but I don't know why this was ever a thing in the first place.  And with my current phone (Google Pixel 8), if I text a selfie to someone, it seems it saves the selfie mirrored, regardless of the fact that I have that option disabled.

Where do we draw the line on what is too dangerous?  \n\nSince the dawn of civilization we have had one on one contests for glory and profit as well as entertainment. We have set aside for the most part contests to the death or cripling injury such as unprotected fighting with edged weapons, and we have been hovering at the level set by boxing and now MMA. Violent, sometimes ugly... but even then there are rules to mitigate injury. Modern fighting with blunt instruments or swords involves armor and strict rules. And the more extreme forms of bare knuckle and unregulated underground fighting are often rejected like we reject dog fighting and cock fighting.\n\nBut amidst the modern conversation of CTE and brain injury affecting popular sports, we now see Slap Fighting. No chance to avoid injury. There can be no debate... it is literally mashing the brains of people against the insides of their skull. EVERY hit is the same as the worst hit a fighter takes in a match, possibly a career. It is the concentration of the worst parts of boxing, and that is ALL it is. There is no art or chance to avoid anything. \n\nIn summation... I already have a tough time with many combat sports but at least they have a CHANCE at avoiding the worst of it - they are an actual test of one's self and opponent. It makes me sick that Slap Fighting is compared to the more brutal sports, much less the noble combat sports like BJJ and Arm Wrestling. I believe only bad things can come of it, and anyone who supports Slap Fighting is making a moral and ethical mistake. It is not a martial art, it is not a risk or test, it is only pure self destruction and currently one of the lowest forms of entertainment.",

Contrast this with the Warhammer 40k franchise, it branches and expands into many different types of conflicts, trauma and even different genres for its setting. Yes, Chaos corruption is always the endgame there but the paths are very different. \n\n\nSomething like Space Hulk/Alien theming could even work for the Star Wars setting, yet we get retreaded plot beats about Jedi & failed Padawan over & over",

        "text": "As someone who's in a lot of dead fandoms, it's way better when a fandom is either dead or small. Being on a large fandom just sucks, it feels like every second someone in the fandom is exposed as problematic, there are arguments every second, it's like every large fandom is just full of toxic people that are only there to make the fandom's reputation drop. Being in a dead/small fandom, however, is pretty chill, since there are barely any people in it there are not that many weird or problematic people, it's all pretty calm, there are still some arguments and \"stuff\" but it's mostly just pretty chill in general.\n\nI don't get why people go like \"uhhhh my fandom is so small waaaa thats so sad it needs to be more recognized\" and that's something i don't agree with. Have you seen what the internet did to Digital Circus, Fundamental Paper Education, the Backrooms and other things that were once popular? Yeah, you should be thankful that your fandom isn't that big and enjoy while it is still small, for example, Making Fiends isn't that big of a fandom (right now) and i think it's better that way.\n\nHonestly, i'm just trying to enjoy the time i have where the small fandoms i'm in are small and not that known, it's only a matter of time before the internet absolutely shreds it. I hate living in this reality where we can't have ONE thing untouched by the internet, i really need to permashift.\n\nTL;DR The internet ruins fandoms (or just anything in general) so it's better when your fandom is small and not that known.",

        "text": "People are quick to claim we've moved past the brutal practices of history, like burning women for witchcraft or the horrors of slavery. Yet today, emotions and groupthink still cloud our judgment-when a collective shares a sentiment, many are quick to adopt it without questioning its validity. This makes it easy to fall into the same mindsets that existed in the past. For instance, during the early 20th century, there was mass hysteria and fear during the Red Scare, where innocent people were accused of being communists, often with little evidence. While these examples may seem less extreme than the barbaric practices of the past, the amount of blinded emotion today suggests that, left unchecked, people could just as easily commit atrocious acts.\nThis is evident even in extreme, unwarranted 'hate trains' over trivial issues. We see people piling on hate for something as minor as being annoying or mildly problematic-where many join in on the outrage without genuinely caring about what the person did. A good example is cancel culture, where someone's mistake-whether it's a poorly worded tweet or a past behaviour (excluding bigotry)-is met with excessive outrage and attacks, even if most people don't care that much about the issue. People are quick to jump on the bandwagon without thinking critically. This shows that our collective behavior mirrors past barbaric practices, proving human nature hasn't evolved as much as we'd like to think. while we\u2019ve evolved away from these particular acts, the mechanisms that allowed them to happen\u2014emotional manipulation, fear-based decision-making, and groupthink\u2014are still very much present.\n\n",

Also he\u2019s unfunny.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nMy understanding of the whole affair is as follows:\n\n1. Jay Leno didn\u2019t want to retire. He was pushed out by the studio.\n2. Upon being pushed out, he indicated that he would seek employment elsewhere.\n3. Not wanting him working for a competing network, the studio instead gave him a show with an earlier slot.\n4. The earlier slot split the audience \u2013 Conan\u2019s show suffered as a result.\n5. The studio reneged on Conan, and cut him a fat cheque for his troubles. Leno resumed as host of the Tonight Show.\n\nI\u2019m gob smacked that anyone can see this order of events and think that Leno did anything wrong here. Can you imagine, in your personal life, having your dream job and your bosses being like \u201cWe want you to retire so that we can bring in a younger guy who we like more. That\u2019s cool right? Also please sign this non-compete agreement and go away.\u201d\n\nNo effing way. Of course you\u2019d fight tooth and nail to hang on. Anyone calling you an asshole for doing so would be laughed out of the room.\n\nLeno didn\u2019t owe anything to Conan. Was Conan done dirty by the studio? Sure. But that\u2019s not on Leno. He\u2019s not responsible for him or his career. Further, I think Conan was (and continued to be) doing just fine without the gig, so the overflow of sympathy for someone that wealthy and privileged was/is unwarranted.\n\nWhenever these events comes up, there\u2019s also a piece about how Leno was never particularly funny. I think that this is subjective and irrelevant. He had a stellar run as host of the show, regardless of anyone\u2019s opinion about his comedic value. Clearly some people found him enjoyable to watch. I think that\u2019s an objective truth.\n\nLastly, Leno just generally seems like a good dude. Eff the haters.

        "text": "I often see this sentiment where if you actively do something (or have done something) and talk against it, you're just a hypocrite. That's not even logical and it's complete bullshit to anyone that actually thinks about it. \n\nExample; someone that smokes tobacco telling people that smoking tobacco is negative and stupid. You'll always get offended people complaining about \"well YOU do it!!\" but it's like no shit, that's literally why I'm talking about it and that's literally why I have the qualifications and justification to talk about it. It isn't even logical to call someone a hypocrite. Every addicted smoker on earth should know it's stupid and they just push people away from the addiction. Any logical smoker that's mature enough to admit their problems would do just that. If you have literal experience and knowledge of something, it makes logical sense to share that knowledge. Who is someone going to listen to more; someone that's actually been through it and living through it, or someone that just read a few online articles? Come on now. \n\nBut the thing is, people are so half assed on what they call hypocrite. They usually only call someone a hypocrite when it's about something they personally feel some kind of way about, regardless if what they're saying is the truth. Like to bring me back to the original example; just because I/someone smokes tobacco, that literally doesn't change anything that's being stated or the truth behind it. Being offended that someone that's there/been there is talking negatively about it is just ignorant. With experience comes wisdom, with wisdom comes life lessons. That's just the way it goes. \n\nAlmost everyone laughs, claps and cheers for inmates in prison that do the \"beyond scared straight\" programs; showing the youth their mistakes and where it could bring them. Talking against the things they used to do doesn't make them a hypocrite, it makes them someone that's sharing firsthand, secondhand and third hand knowledge. Just because someone doesn't like what's being stated doesn't magically make them a hypocrite. It means they're teaching and influencing people to not make those same decisions. \n\nThere's a line though. Is it \"wrong\" for someone to make another out to be the most fucked up person in existence when they currently do the same things as them? In a way, yeah, that would be hypocrisy, but either way that doesn't magically change or remove the fact that their actions could use adjusting. People all too often get sensitive about what someone says, call them a hypocrite and then just completely shut out anything logical that's being stated. Ignoring logic because you don't like who's saying it (or how it's being said) is just immature ignorance. You don't need to like who's saying it, you don't need to like how it's being said, but actively ignoring the truth behind the statements is arrogance. And if it's coming from someone that's literally living that life? Just quit getting offended and be open/mature enough to hear them out. \n\nMoral of the post; quit calling everyone that has experience with something a hypocrite when they talk against it. That's what happens when people want to teach and push others to do better than them. Are you not gonna listen to a drug addict telling you not to get into the drugs they're doing because it'll ruin your life, just because you arrogantly don't want to listen? \n\nNothing everything is being a hypocrite lol. \n\nHope everyone is doing good. Hope everyone in your lives is healthy and alive. Enjoy the rest of your Monday. ",

        "text": "I keep hearing people say that caring about aesthetics is shallow or pointless, but I disagree. I think aesthetics are actually a legit way to figure out who you are. Sure, it\u2019s not everything, but the aesthetics you vibe with can help you express yourself, find your values, and even guide your personal growth.\n\nWhy do people assume that caring about how something looks makes it superficial? When you explore different aesthetics\u2014whether it\u2019s the way you dress, how you design your space, or what kind of art and music you\u2019re into\u2014it\u2019s not just about looking good for others. It\u2019s about finding what feels right for you and what makes you feel like the most authentic version of yourself.\n\nIf someone\u2019s into minimalism, maybe it\u2019s because they want more peace and simplicity in their life. If someone\u2019s embracing bright colors and chaotic styles, maybe it reflects their bold personality. It\u2019s not just \u201csuperficial,\u201d it\u2019s a reflection of who they are and what they value.\n\nI think people are quick to dismiss aesthetics because they associate them with vanity or consumerism, but when used thoughtfully, they can be powerful tools for self-expression and even personal growth.\n\nSo, exploring aesthetics isn\u2019t shallow\u2014it\u2019s a real way to discover and express your authentic self. \nWhat do you think?",

They pose issues without judgment or chastising. I truly don\u2019t think any \u201cedgy\u201d teen media has done like Degrassi before or ever since. ",

Of course people should do their own research. But, that fact is not an excuse for one to not back up their claim. In fact, someone could do their own research AND ask for the source for the claim that someone is making. Furthermore, wouldn't you want to see the piece(s) of evidence that convinced who your talking with? You may be convinced right away but either way you could evaluate the legitimacy of the source.\n\n\n2. \"People that ask for a source are disingenuous\". If that's the case, then that is their issue. You can still supply the source that convinced you of your claim and that would be up to the other person to actually look at it or change their mind. If they're looking for some sort of \"Gotcha\" moment because you're unable to back up your claim, then you can turn that around on them by providing evidence.\n\n\nBottom line, there's no good reason to withhold the evidence you have for a claim. Unless, you don't actually have evidence, in which case, why are you claiming something you have no proof for?",

If your team loses the game youre watching people are going to make fun of your team and you as a fan of that team and half the fanbase with 1 loss is going to demand the coach fired and to start over. Case in point Alabama and Ohio State in recent weeks. Its less having fun watching your team and more hoping to God that they dont lose the game. Where as a team without that its more fun to just watch the game and if your team wins thats great and if not oh well just wasnt their day. ",

        "text": "I'll explain what I'm talking about first. We all know the term \"basic\" where one's taste is very popular and, in turn, boring. Here are some examples. Someone's favourite song by an artist is their most famous song. Someone's favourite food is the original flavour. Someone watches mainstream reality TV. And if you relate to this, you might have been called \"basic\" by someone else.\n\nIt's simple why I think this term is an odd insult. Things are popular for a reason. If you like something that a crowd of people likes, it should be a good thing, right? That you have opinions that a lot of people agree with. \n\nThe same goes the other way. Unique styles don't make you better than anyone else. If you like chains and fishnet gloves, go for it. Self-expression is a generally positive thing. But if you think you're better than the people who wear Lululemon and have Stanley cups, you're wrong. Art is subjective, and you shouldn't be putting down someone else's self-expression. \n\nHere's another example, with music. Your favourite singer can be Taylor Swift, and it can also be Nirvana or something. If your favourite composer is Beethoven, don't force yourself to like Schoenberg just to be different. Your favourite Sabrina Carpenter song could absolutely be Espresso, instead of finding a niche song made 6 years ago just to be unique.\n\nWe were always told to be ourselves, so why should we forget that? If you agree, or even disagree, tell me why. Thank you for reading this long tangent.",

        "text": "A TV-show, a movie, a book or any other piece of media that takes heavy inspiration from another story or is in many aspects kind of a \"rip-off\" of this story is not necessarily bad. To me it is the execution of the story which matters. Is it entertaining, is it well made with interesting characters, good cinematography and an exciting and interesting story? If yes, I don't care that if it is the 100th iteration of the same old trope.\n\nLet's be honest, is there any story that is really 100% original. Everything which can be said or told has already been said or told. We can vary these old stories, give them new interesting twists and it will be a masterpiece.\n\nA new \"original\" story with truly new ideas is not automatically good. If the story is boring, bland and poorly made it will not be saved by its originality. Often it is quite the opposite where the novelty is the only aspect that makes a story notable, but the lack in execution kills it.\n\nI would rather have the 10 millionth adaptation of Snow White if it is well made and interesting than this new flashy epic tale that falls flat on its nose.\n\nAn example is the anime series \"Darling in the Franxx\" which gets lots of hate for various reason, one of them being that it is said to be a rip-off of \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\". I personally loved the show despite thinking that some of the criticisms have some reason, but that DitF is an Evangelion rip-off is none of them. Yes, it has many elements that are heavily inspired from the other show, but it does not take away from its qualities. It is its own story with interesting characters and great developments. That many scenes are basically copies from Evangelion scenes does not spoil the fun for me.",

        "text": "A lot of people seem to dismiss and discredit things they don't immediately understand. There was a post here saying that David Lynch films were completely incomprehensible and therefore have no value, and don't know what they're talking about. While I understand that stories and art told in a non-literal way can be confusing, I think that there's often times a lot more beneath the surface. \n\nSurrealism as an art form started to become prevalent shortly after Sigmund Freud released his book The Interpretation of Dreams\n\nSurrealism is considered a dreamlike art form, and some of the most well known surrealists were also interested in exploring their connection to their dreams, and interpreting what their dreams meant on a deeper level.\n\nSalvador Dali especially loved the theoretical ideas of Freuds book, and considers it to be one the most life changing discoveries.\n\nThis connection between the two, psychology, and dreams, seems to set the ground for surrealism.\n\nIf you look at art, wether that be film, painting, literature, or music. Whatever form that uses surrealism, it's often not because the artists are just \"throwing spaghetti at the wall, to see what sticks.\" Through the lens of their dreams they are trying to express something about themselves that they may not even be conscious of. \n\nZdzslaw beksinki, a polish surrealist started painting because he wanted to \"paint his nightmares\" when he started expressing his dream through the surrealist lens, it often became a dystopian nightmarish hellscape, the images are very dark and cerebral. A lot of his work is of gaunt, withered, distorted figures that appear in some state of dispare, or large authoritarian figures that appear as domineering and aggressive. \n\nThis starts to make sense when you consider that beksinki was raised as a boy in a post world War one poland, and lived his years into adulthood through the second world War. The images he made were likely him trying to express the frustration the helplessness, the hunger, the evil that he saw going on around him every single day.\n\nI could go on for hours with more examples, Francis Bacon, Franz Kuafka, Kurt Vonnegut, Charlie Kuafman, David Lynch, so on... \n\nBut the point would be the same, all of them try to express something about themselves, or the world around them in a way that may not seem like it makes sense, but is often a very introspective and thought out and human exploration. Even if it's not a literal interpretation of the things happening in the image.\n\nImagine an image of a pomegranate sitting on white cloth. The background is pitch black, except the dough eyes of a sad woman peering out from the darkness, just barely visble, her tears fall behind the pomegranate. It's been stabed with a sharp blade. A large hand of a male has been cut off, and now grips the blades handle. The pomegranate leaks deep red juice, which leaves the white cloth stained, and soaked.\n\nWhat is this image? Is it just a pomegranate which has now been cut? Or is this the expression of a woman who cannot have children? The pomegranate representing her fertility, or rather her lack thereof. The hand representing not only the hand of a potential ex lover who has left her with this infertile state, but also one who has been detached, but still lingers with the blade inside of her. Taking forever from her, the one thing that was hers. \n\nSymbolism is important, it can convey so much that isn't spoken. \n\nEverything isn't literal. The more we try to make it literal, the less meaning it has. ",

Then in 2020 it crossed into $510,400. \n\nAt the end of this year and currently for many lenders, the limit just shifted up to $802,650 which is a 65% increase in just 5 years. \n\nNow whats interesting here is that from 2006-2016, the loan limit remained at 417,000. The average price of a home from 2006-2016 went from 247,700 to 311,00 over a decade for a 25% increase. \n\nAt the start of 2019 the average home was 313,000 and today sits around 412,000 which is a 32% increase in half the time. \n\nThere is a notable upswing from 2020 to just 2022 where a home was 329,000 to 437,700 and thats a 33% increase in just 2 years. \n\nLong of the short, housing is rising abnormally fast and the govt whom sets these limits has done nothing but encourage higher prices. \n\nIf loan limits were still back at the 500k level, we simply wouldn\u2019t see the pace of value increase so incredibly. You may want to sell your home for some egregious number, but good luck finding a buyer. Its this rolling of limits up that is the root problem of housing being so expensive. \n\nLenders specifically don\u2019t lend their own money, but the govt\u2019s money. If the loan forecloses, your bank takes no hit at all, but the govt pays them out. Mortgage insurance/PMI exists specifically to help the govt recoup forclosed property and payouts to lenders. \n\nEveryone talks about all these solutions to the craziness that is the housing market, but its as simple as the govt not blindly raising limits. One may say that this would price regular people out of loans, but this is false as the lenders wouldn\u2019t bother lending their own money anyways. Home would *have* to stay cheaper to accommodate demand. Thus the fix is much simpler than everyone makes it out to be. Stop raising these dam limits and all of a sudden people will be able to afford homes again. ",

Roughly defined as spaces that are in in-between states, or in some way unnerving or unnatural. Usually it's places you'd expect to be populated but they aren't. A swimming pool without anyone in it, a long lit but abandoned hallway, etc.\n\nLike ... fine. If you want to make a 3d render of an empty hallway, go nuts. But *please* don't pretend like that's supposed to be really scary. It's not. It's an empty hallway, and an obviously fake one at that. Can we *please* stop pretending that a game where you simply walk through empty spaces is a horror experience? Can we *please* drop the faux-philosophical undertones like this is some really intellectual, deep thing?\n\nAll I see is a 3d render of a space made by someone who cba or isn't capable of filling said space with detail like people, creatures, plants, etc. All I see is a game where the devs just made some levels and stopped developing right there an then while saying \"ooooh scary!\".\n\nYou know what we used to call a 3d model/render of an empty hallway? A beginner tutorial project.\n\nIt's dumb, no matter how deep you think liminality is. If you have to explain why your game or art is supposed to be scary, it's not scary.",

Yes, it was made on a small budget. It has glitches. It's not polished like RDR and definitely not a \"AAA\" game. However, no other game does what KCD does. A grounded story based in reality. No \"save the world\" going on. It's a very personal story. The choices, the combat, lockpicking, perks, stats, gear, exploring, etc etc.\nIt's also damn amazing that we got a medieval game WITHOUT Tolkien influence.\n\nKingdom Come Deliverance is the best game ever developed and I can't wait until February for KCDII",

I wrote whiskey off as just not being great for mixed drinks.\n\nUntil last Saturday. A friend at the bar recommended I try Jack and Sprite (and it was my first drink of the night, so no drunk judgements lol) and I was blown away at just how well the whiskey seemed to mesh together with the crisp flavor of the Sprite. I kept sipping the drink, expecting it to get nasty at some point, but it never did.\n\nEarlier tonight, I decided to try the mix at home, to rule out the possibility of the bar pouring light shots into my drink.

Everyone who experiences this kind of media experiences it in at least a slightly different way from anyone else. You know you've made something like this when many people agree that it's good, but everyone has a different opinion on why it's good. Let's call this layer \"Savory\".\n\n\nThen, you have media that's just fun. What you see is what you get, and it's a good time where you don't have to think too much. There's not a lot of substance, but the execution of the style makes it a pleasant experience. You know you've made this when everyone knows exactly why it's good just from watching it.  Let's call this layer \"Sweet\".\n\n\nAfter that, you have media that's dumb and bad. It's not trying to be smart and isn't claiming to, but also isn't giving the audience what it craves in terms of style. This is most often seen in adaptations of previously known media that doesn't deliver on what made the original good. These are your run-of-the-mill cash grabs that make no attempt to even seem like they care. You know you've made this when people just forget it and move on, or complain that it just didn't give them what they wanted. Let's call this layer \"Bland\".\n\n\nFinally, at the bottom of the barrel, you have media that wants to seem meaningful and like it's saying something, but the commentary it delivers is superficial, on-the-nose, or just flat-out nonsensical. The kind that doesn't speak for itself but the creator insists it does while begging to be asked for an explanation so that it doesn't have to. This is the media that insults its audience the most, and is the most unpleasant to experience, because it actively harms the audience's ability to think about what they're experiencing by forcing them to think but giving them nothing of substance to actually think about. No amount of style will save this kind of media from how blatantly it lies about having substance. You know you've made this when you've pissed off the audience to the point where they question your integrity as an artist. Let's call this layer \"Bitter\". \n\n\nWhat pieces of media come to mind when you hear about each of these layers and what they mean?",

You apologise because you don't want to be excluded and you don't want to lose the benefits that came with having a friend.

That's why some people don't like receiving gifts; they know they have to pay it back somehow. \n\nThis is a bit more harsh but even having children and sacrificing stuff for them is to ensure that your genetics and bloodline continues. That goal may not be something we actively think about but our inherent instincts doing so.\n\nDonating or giving to charity is to make yourself feel better and to make yourself look good too. When you adopt a stray puppy is it ultimately to help it or yourself? Satisfying ourselves is our number one goal in life and being generous and giving to others supports that. We have been educated since birth what is good and bad thus we try to do the good  to make ourselves be good. Even horrible people genuinely think they're doing the right thing. A bit extreme but say Hitler he didn't think he was evil and a dictator yes he probably liked being powerful but he was probably thinking he was helping Germany and its citizens. \n\nThis is a bad explanation but I think that everyone is 'selfish' in a way and that our perception of good or bad people is just based on how honest they're really being.

But I've just really never understood the point.\n\nI understand that every school is different, but in my high school it always seemed like school spirit was just a tactic by the administration to distract us from our school's problems. Sure, our school can't go a year without someone killing themselves, but let's focus on the big homecoming game against Smallville instead! I understand why the school wants to create  a strong sense of community, but if you want students to take pride in the school, then actually try to fix the issues instead of sweeping them under the carpet.\n\nEven without taking that into consideration though, it just seems pointless. I don't go to school to go to football games or dances, I go to school to learn. That's it. The whole point of school is that you leave at some point. So why form an emotional connection to a place that you're only going to be in for four years? \n\nCollege is a little different. I understand why people have more connections to college: a) they actually choose to go there, b) they most likely lived on the campus at some point, so it was basically a second home, and c) the friendships you make in college are a lot more stronger than the ones you make in high-school. But it still seems kind of pointless. You go to college to learn skills that will get you your ideal career. If you're just watching football and going to parties, you're in college for all the wrong reasons. \n\nTL;DR - A school is a vehicle for education. That's it. The purpose of school is to meet all the requirements, then move on. There is literally no reason for you to have an emotional attachment to your school. The only people I've met that have school spirit are the people that wish they could say in high school/college forever. And if you feel that way, you've done something very wrong.",

Like have you been able to predict movies and TV shows lately? I don't know if the plot twist makes it more palpable to the viewers so it's always a happy ending, but to me a happy ending isn't necessarily satisfying about it. Like I'd prefer if it did something I didn't expect and be shocked and pissed off for abit, but still rave about the movie. \n\n\nMy favorite example of this is \"frozen\"(childish I know) but I would've liked it more if khristoff and Anna stayed friends for a little while and Anna developed her relationship with Hans and in the second movie she figures out Hans and her aren't really compatible and she gets closer to Kristoff or something like that. I don't know I just feel movies and TV are so predictable.  I want to watch something and be like \"I can already see where it's heading\" amd it turns out to be the exact opposite.

        "text": "Basically if you don't know, a tech YouTuber launched a wallpaper app that has an option to subscribe to it for $50 a year. This gives you access to every high resolution wallpaper on the app. It is important to note, that you do not need any subscription to access the app. The app right now has been fixed so that you have access to every 1080p wallpaper for free, and if you want the high resolution version of a particular wallpaper. You can watch an ad. Before this update, there were ads in the app that were unavoidable if you you didn't pay. Now this really is down to personal preference, but what \"free\" app do you know of that doesn't have ads? I may be glossing over a couple of other things that people did not like about the app, but the main gripe that many people had was that \"it cost $50\"\n\n I think that this gripe is overblown and even childish. It's a wallpaper app. It's not like Marques (the YouTuber in question) put all of his content behind  a paywall. It's not like he promised a free app and then pull the rug under everyone and announce that it was a paid app at the last minute. This was a random passion project, that was meant to give people high quality wallpapers AND MORE IMPORTANTLY support artists. Half of the proceeds that the app makes goes towards the artists, and that has always been the case for the app, not something that they added in an update.\n\nI just don't see how not downloading this app isn't the easiest way to avoid it. You think the prices are too expensive? Don't download it. Do you think the app was janky and had too many ads? Cool, don't download it. Personally, I wouldn't spend $200 on a Gucci belt, but that doesn't mean I want Gucci to take every belt that they have off their shelves, rework them, and then sell them again so that it meets standards to my liking. Instead, I am comfortable living in a world that has things that are not for me. \n\n",

Secondly, it frees up people to recline without hindering the person behind them.\n\nThe only real negative I can see, and I'm happy to be proven wrong, is that it does seem like it would be more claustrophobic for the people on the bottom row. The whole, \"You'll get pink eye every flight\" thing doesn't hold any merit in my eyes. Every picture I've seen of the double deckers has a seat and a solid barrier between the person on top and the person behind them, so it doesn't appear the risk of pink eye would be any higher on this type of plane compared to a regular plane.\n\n",

You can hear the bands progression from a jazz theater group in the early to mid 70s to their transition into New Wave (which started around 76 to 77)",

        "text": "Often I read and hear people say that it is the worst movie ever made. I imagine such judgments are made because it is being compared to The Exorcist, however I feel that, compared to the first movie, I actually prefer the second one.\n\nThe first movie suffers from the same drawbacks as many early 70s movies. The first hour or so is incredibly dull and lifeless. Many of the scenes are unnecessary and the structure is incoherent. \n\nMeanwhile the second movie actually creates a \u201cmythology\u201d surrounding the demon in the first film, gives it an origin in Pazuzu and the African mythology, something that it rarely covered in mainstream Hollywood film. The often ridiculed hypnotism scenes are nowhere near ludicrous as some other scenes seen in other horror movies of the time and even now. If the machine is considered OTT, then really the act of hypnotism in movies as a whole should be considered OTT. It\u2019s just a method they use for the movie to make it more visual.\n\nFinally I think the acting is not that bad. Richard Burton, a personal favourite of mine, is admittedly not at his strongest, which is no doubt due to his drinking, yet he still has presence to carry the film. I think Linda Blair is just as good here as in the first one and Louise Fletcher is good too, as it James Earle Jones (who actually trumps Burton in their scene together).\n\nIs the Exorcist 2 the best movie ever made? Of course it isn\u2019t. Is it the worst? Definitely not. ",

The play-by-play guy actually was only half-bad on this call (he only kinda screamed like a banshee) but the color commentator just yells \"YEAH!\" a bunch of times and you could hear him either falling or knocking shit off his desk. All in all, radio announcers are routinely awful listens and   ruin your experience listening to the game when you have to listen to it on the radio/radio stream. \n\nWhat's worse is that they are extremely good at the actual craft of broadcasting. They often do a remarkable job of painting a picture of what is happening on the field/ice - so you can see the ability is there - but they can't resist acting like blithering fools during a broadcast: yelling, ignoring whenever the opponent does anything well, not admitting they were wrong when replays or rules say they are, saying \"we/us/our\" etc. \n\nOne caveat: this does not apply to New York City or Los Angeles sports teams. Those guys are super professional and while they obviously get MORE excited when the home team succeeds they aren't completely disinterested or dispassionate when the opponent does something well. The further you get away from NYC/LA, the worse it gets. The Tampa Bay Lightning have the worst I have ever heard. I'm surprised they even say the other team's name.\n\nAlso, for extra bonus for those in Seattle: [Bret Musberger's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUK6opejgA8) call of Martinez' double is so much better than [Niehaus'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8SBJzOEcyU)",

Whereas with dubbing, there's always a disconnect between the regular audio and the dubbed audio, the lines feel awkwardly written to conform to the lib sync, and it's almost always done by bad impersonators of the actors (though I think *Pulp Fiction* was done by the movie's actual stars). Muting is better, less awkward, and doesn't compromise the dialogue as badly.\n\nEdit: I'm not saying any kind of editing of profanity is \"the good kind\" (they're both definitely annoying) I'm just saying that one is better.",

In this sense the ethics of a relationship should also include how would be the method in case things go south, because sometimes behaviors in the ending process can throw away all the sense of worth of time and live given. \n\nObviously it can't be applied to all cases, but in general I guess this aspect of human (des)connection is blindsided such death in live as a subject of discussion.\n\nJust look at No Contact as a standard method of what happens after ending and people staying hooked in a lot of illusions with no touch of reality. A lot of unecessary pain. \n\nCommunication, closure, to be avaliable to give answers and to promote respect after a love story should be a quintessential to more healthy relationships and to avoid the majority of people to carry unecessary bagages to the next connection. And this behavior check should be mandatory as a trait check before como together with someone.\n\nAnd I believe that should be more a thing. As far as it can sound strange, sometimes even exes in people lives as friends is a sign that people really get over each other and was able to give them other meanings.

The reason why is because the trends in gaming changed and people hid their true feelings.\n\nFFXIII just was against the trends at of gaming at the time. Let me run down the list\n\n1: The game is Linear, I admit it could have had more to do but Final Fantasy games have always been linear other games just gave you more illusion of choice. I like that this doesn't waste your time with so much walking. This was around the time of games like GTA and Skyrim.\n\n2: It is a very decadent maximalist game. This was when minimalist games with muted color pallets were all the rage. FFXIII is glossy and colorful. It also is very elegant and almost cosmopolitan in it's look contrasted with the hard boiled macho games of it's day. This even shows in the UI. The UI looks a lot like Fruitger Aero which again was starting to be hated at the time but is seeing a comeback in style\n\n3: It takes itself very seriously, this was at the time when millennial irony was starting to get big and games with a laid back I don't care attitude were all the rage. Think games like GTA and Saints Row. I like that the game takes itself seriously and doesn't wink at the audience constantly.",

The \u201cStar Wars\u201d franchise has expanded so much I don\u2019t know how fans can even keep up. Furthermore being a Disney fan doesn\u2019t necessarily make you a Star Wars fan and vice versa. \n\nDisney keeps tearing down/ rebuilding attractions to replace them with SW themed rides/attractions. It makes more sense to me to build a whole SW themed park and make as many attractions as they want completely separate from their original park. Then SW fans could be submerged into the SW universe without stumbling back into the regular ol Disney cartoonish nostalgia. \n\nI know it costs billions to complete a build this big but they\u2019re Disney, DISNEY!!! they can afford it, they own practically every channel. The park might be alleviated of such heavy traffic yet they would be gaining revenue from 2 separate parks at that point. Also less heavy traffic leads to a better experience for park goers and may lead to them returning more frequently.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if you like SW or not it just doesn\u2019t make sense to me to mash it all together and tear down classics to make way for a franchise they recently acquired.

People on both sides think that collectivism and individualism are mutually exclusive. It goes like this for people who sided with collectivism thinks that if collectivism works in the culture the results will be that the country or society have harmony, social cohesion, be clean interdependence and much more but it will hamper creativity, uniqueness, individual thoughts, innovation and much more. On the other hand, people who sided with individidualism thinks that if individidualism works in the culture the country or society will have creativity, high GDP, innovation, high intellegence and much more but it will hamper, social cohesion, it will have conflicts, the country and cities will be dirty, no teamwork and much more.\u00a0\n\nPeople who sided with collectivism and others who sided with individualism are arguring by giving out reasons why they choose their side.\n\nPeople who sided with collectivism against individualism will say:\n\n\u201cCollectivism is better because it\u2019ll make the country and society be clean, have no conflicts, harmony and much more. While individualism is bad because it\u2019ll make the country and society have conflicts, be dirty, no public property, selfishness and much more. That\u2019s why there are countries and cities that are clean, have selfless people and much more because they value collectivism since it\u2019s superior while individualism is bad for the country and society.\u201d\n\nPeople who sided with individualism against collectivism will say:\n\n\u201cScrew that, individualism is better because it\u2019ll make the country and society have creativity, high GDP, innovation, privacy and much more. While collectivism is bad because it\u2019ll make the country and society have no creativity,\u00a0\u00a0low GDP, no innovation, lack of privacy and much more. This is why America especially hollywood and the UK are big at making movies and tv shows because they value individualism which includes creativity. Germany made advanced technologies because individualism is better which includes innovation. While collectivism is bad for the country and society.\u201d\n\nThis argument is getting out of hand and getting so much debate and it needs to stop because in reality, collectivism and individualism are not mutually exclusive they co exist at the same time within all countries and societies and also these two are not the only reasons why there are countries and societies that are clean, creative, innovative, have harmony, high GDP and much more. It goes like this:\n\n1. America is being proclaimed as Individualistic but in scenarios like construction sites and road work, teamwork is required because it needs a lot of people to build and work there which teamwork is a key point of collectivism, so therefore collectivistic culture exist in America. (Personally it\u2019s safe me to say, America is a collectivistic country or society.)\n2. South Korea is being proclaimed as Collectivstic but in scenarios like making technologies, innovation is required because they want to make technologies advanced and innovative which innovation is a key point of Individualism, so therefore individualistic culture exist there in South Korea.\n3. Sweden is also being proclaimed as Individualistic but the country is also clean and it\u2019s either because of different aspect of culture or policies. So therefore, individualism does not automatically mean the country will be dirty which people think that it\u2019ll make the country dirty but it\u2019s untrue.\n4. Japan is also being proclaimed as collectivism but in scenarios like making video games, anime, TV shows and movies, creativity is required because they want to make these things so creative which creativity is a key point of individualism, so therefore individualism culture exist in Japan.\n\nSo these are the countries I point out that you need to understand that collectivism and individualism are not mutually exclusive but they co exist at the same time even in many countries that are proclaimed as collectivistic and other proclaimed as individualistic. You also gotta understand that collectivism and individualism are not the only reasons why countries and societies are clean, have creativity, innovation, people who wants privacy, high GDP and much more.",

Standalone content that gets a sequel (or many sequels) is not diminished because there exists extra content. Hellraiser comes to mind here, as in my opinion the movies get worse as time goes on (enjoyed the most recent one, though), but the first two are still just as excellent as they ever have been. I enjoy sequels, I like to see where the protagonist goes after the fact, or how the world develops post-incident. If there\u2019s an audience for it, it\u2019s justified.\n\nCriticizing remakes in particular because they weren\u2019t \u201cneeded\u201d doesn\u2019t make any sense to me at all. We remake things because we\u2019re inspired by them and want to reimagine them, or because we think it would be interesting to see how it went if it went slightly differently, or if a role was played by someone who wasn\u2019t around for the original. Not every remake is a hit, or even necessarily good, but I\u2019m usually glad they tried or intrigued to see how it goes when I\u2019m walking into the theater.\n\nAnd look, I\u2019m not naive, I\u2019m well aware that money is a massive driving factor behind these films, and that they\u2019re not all artistic passion projects, but money\u2019s a motivation for a lot of original work too. I don\u2019t think they need to be put on a pedestal, but regardless of why they were made, the final product can still be enjoyed, but these films definitely don\u2019t need to be justified, nor should the be criticized for existing just because there wasn\u2019t an overt need for them.",

        "text": "Just to be clear, I don\u2019t mean the least entertaining, or that she is my least favorite character. I mean out of all people on the show, her moral compass is the most askew. \n\nNow, I know lots of people will rush to say Barney or Ted, and while they aren\u2019t great either (and neither is Robin frankly) in my opinion Lily is far worse than any of them due to her self righteousness. What drives me crazy about her is the way she forces her moral standards and views of the world onto everyone else around her and manipulates the people around her for her own selfish desires, while acting like it\u2019s for their own good. \n\nBefore I get into that I\u2019ll discuss the flaws of other characters. \n\nBarney doesn\u2019t pretend to be a good person. He knows very well that he doesn\u2019t treat women how they should be treated and doesn\u2019t try to pretend to be a good person when he isn\u2019t, and it\u2019s something he really seems to wrestle with and grow from throughout the show as he learns to not be afraid of commitment. (Ignore the last two episodes where him and Robin get divorced. \n\nTed has main character syndrome without a doubt. He takes everything that happens to him as a sign from the universe that this girl is the one. When he likes a girl he expects it to be reciprocal and tries on multiple occasions to go out with women under false pretenses in a Barney like way. Except he\u2019s the \u201cnice guy\u201d and the \u201chopeless romantic\u201d which imo makes him worse than Barney because Barney doesn\u2019t pretend to be something he isn\u2019t. \n\nRobin isn\u2019t exactly a cup of tea either. She knows she can\u2019t give the men in her life (except for Barney) the sort of commitment they would be looking for, so she strings them along instead of being alone so that she can fulfill her short term sexual and romantic desires, and dumps this guys as soon as they stop being easy or as soon as they catch onto robins plan. \n\nMarshall is a good dude. I wish he would condemn Lily\u2019s shittiness more, but other than that no problems with the guy. \n\nIn my opinion, all of that pales in comparison to the terribleness of Lily Aldrin. First let us discuss aldrin justice. She views the world as her kindergarten class, and she is the teacher. If someone does something she views as mean, she has the right to take things from them as a form of justice. The amount of self entitlement, self righteousness, and narcissism it takes to see everyone so far below you that you have the right to correct their behavior by taking away their things is absolutely astonishing. \n\nNext, there is how she enforces this view (and others) on the people around her. Ted almost loses his job because Lily stole his bosses ball. She almost caused issues with the captain when she stole his ashtray.\n\nShe also thinks she is the arbiter of relationships in the people around her. She breaks up Ted and his girlfriends over the course of a decade because she doesn\u2019t like how the women would fit into her life. B it she tells herself (and Ted) when it\u2019s for Ted\u2019s own good, when in reality Lily just doesn\u2019t like them. She kidnaps Robin and Barney until they define the terms of their relationship before they are ready. \n\nWhat annoys me the most is how the show presents Lily, as kind and thoughtful. She is a manipulative narcissist and by far the worst character on the show. ",

Those beautifully crafted intros not only set the tone for the show but also build anticipation and immerse us in the world of the story. Whether it\u2019s the haunting melody of Game of Thrones or the nostalgic theme of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, these intros have become a part of the cultural fabric.\n\nHere\u2019s why skipping them is a mistake:\n\n\t1.\tSetting the Mood: Intros create an emotional connection. They prime us for what\u2019s to come, whether it\u2019s excitement, tension, or nostalgia. Skipping them is like diving into a movie without the opening credits\u2014it feels incomplete.\n\t2.\tCultural Significance: Some intros become iconic in their own right, spawning memes, remixes, and fan art. By skipping them, we miss out on a shared cultural experience that brings fans together.\n\t3.\tCharacter Development: Many intros give us visual cues about character arcs and themes that might not be fully explored in the episode. Skipping them means losing out on those important nuances that enhance our understanding of the story.\n\t4.\tLoss of Ritual: For many of us, the ritual of watching a show includes enjoying the intro. It\u2019s a moment to settle in, grab snacks, and mentally prepare for the episode. Rushing past it feels like we\u2019re in a hurry to finish instead of savoring the experience.\n\t5.\tIt\u2019s a Choice: I get that some people want to binge-watch and maximize their time, but isn\u2019t part of the joy of watching TV to enjoy the journey, not just the destination?\n\nSo, next time you\u2019re tempted to hit that \u201cskip intro\u201d button, consider what you might be missing.

Collecting flags of places they have been to in their bio is also often a thing (gotta catch them all i guess? and with them i mean economy flights). How is this different from being a tourist? Also: \"i enjoy eating and buying and being in beautiful places\", big deal?? how are these things considered hobbies. Hobbies should be related to a specific interest, and to my understanding have an element of practice to them, of improvement over time and possibly even of skill. Unless all these people throughly enjoy *all* the cultures in the world to the point that they make an effort to learn languages, research history, try to meet locals in every trip.. you know the actually interest-related, skillful aspect of traveling... i feel like we just fell for yet another trap of capitalism in disguise: consume, show off, repeat.

I couldn\u2019t shave my until 5 days later , this is due to irritation and the neck area specifically gets very sensitive 1-2 days after shaving .\n\n\nNow what I did was pretty much buy a quality modern 3 razor blade razor (80$) and came with 8 razor heads .\n\nMy time to shave went back to 10 minutes, now shaving is easier , better and I can honestly say the modern razor does not irritate my face while still providing a close to edge shave , something that was lacking in the double edged razor .\n\nI also shave weekly with no \u201cfear\u201d of cuts or insane amounts of preparations.\n\n\nI\u2019m putting this because don\u2019t believe everything you see on the internet, regardless how much \u201cauthentic\u201d it seems \n\nTLDR : Tried the double-edged razor hype for 3 months\u2014constant cuts, stubble, and hour-long shaves.

I usually love covers and seeing what other artists do with a concept, but one exception that irks me is the Pentatonix cover of Fleet Foxes White Winter Hymnal. Originally, it was a deep song about innocence and isolation, rooted with folk tones where the singer speaks from the heart; imagery of coldness and snow creating a sort of eeriness. Then Pentatonix makes a vastly over-produced version that has turned the song into a clapping game, like the Cup Song by Anna Kendrick. I will give them credit because they are great singers and can tell they are hitting the harmonies, but I think them choosing to cover that song in this way (overtaking Fleet Foxes in popularity) really removed the soul from it and damaged the meaning of the song to the public eye.",

Elphaba was treated poorly by her father and she's only allowed to go to Shiz under the pretense that she's helping her sister. Her dress at the beginning of the film is covering her whole body (from her feet to a turtleneck and long sleeves) to try and hide her green-ness as much as possible. She is the only person like her in the existence of Oz. Where did she get makeup that matched her skin tone? No way her father would have gotten it for her if it existed. \n\nI'm over thinking this aren't I?",

The scene where the priest starts licking the guy\u2019s head after killing him was a really disturbing and excellent scene and it was unfortunately the last of its kind from that point on. \n\nOnce vampires are introduced it really nosedives in quality. Not in just the silly plot twist but in the writing. The introduction of vampires really ruined the first half for me. Like I thought the show was going a way that was truly original and well done and then it goes \u201clol jk it\u2019s vampires\u201d and it drops all subtly in its criticism of religion. And even the commentary on religion is just inconsistent and almost playing favorites. The Chr1st1an organization is depicted as corrupt, manipulative, and evil but for some reason 1slam gets a pass? The mus1im sheriff is a hero who tries to save everyone and at no point questions his own faith. His son leaves 1slam and because of it he ends up dying but not before converting back to 1slam. Like how are you going to have a show that is a blatant critique on religion but not criticize one of the most oppressive religions and instead depict it in a very positive light? In fact it isn\u2019t \u201calmost playing favorites\u201d it is playing favorites. \n\nIt\u2019s been a while since I saw the show but I also remember the group of heroes at the end also behaving in really dumb ways that would have got them caught by the towns folk in any competently written story.

I just finished a tough interval training session on the track a few days ago, and I was anything but bored. My legs were burning, I was gasping hard, and it took a great degree of mental effort to finish the whole workout. The post-workout euphoria was great. If I had to describe that workout, I would say it was challenging and rewarding. Definitely not boring.\n\nI also don't find longer, slower paced runs boring, as they give me a good opportunity to organise my thoughts, reflect on past events, and process things that have happened to me recently. In today's society, people are almost constantly scrolling on their phones, and most rarely get the opportunity to simply sit in silence with their thoughts. A long, easy run gives me the chance to do just that, while providing health and fitness benefits at the same time.\n\nWhat I like about running is how convenient it is. You don't need to buy a bike, you don't need to travel to a location that has a pool, all you need are a pair of shoes and you're ready to go. You also don't need to master any complicated skills; most people can run with passable form. You can easily adjust the intensity of your workout. Want something light? Just jog slowly. Want to go harder? You can easily push yourself to your absolute limit with some interval sprints.  To me, running is simply the best form of cardio because of how accessible, versatile, and effective it is. ",

        "text": "I even like some live-action adaptations, but animation is the best format to adapt anything related to comics, games, literary sagas, etc. Here are my arguments:\n\n1. Live-action tends to become outdated quickly because depending on when you watch it, the effects might have already aged. Even some of today's live-actions suffer a bit from cheap CGI, and with the amount of money spent, they could have made an animation that, even if simple, would still be great.\n2. Animations can make characters extremely faithful to the original works they are based on. I find it really strange, for example, to watch *The Last of Us* and see characters that don\u2019t resemble those from the game. While people might love that series, I don't enjoy it as much. But aside from that, which is considered good, the best video game adaptations have been done in animation.\n3. Cartoons never age. Look at the upcoming *Harry Potter* series, for example. They're looking for a 10-year-old actor to match the first book. However, a season of a series takes much longer to produce than a movie (considering a cinematic budget). So at some point, we'll find it odd that the actor's age doesn't match the character, like what happened with *Stranger Things* (even though that show wasn't based on anything).\n4. Live-actions are limited. As good as CGI effects can be nowadays, nothing beats the creative freedom and infinite possibilities that animation offers.\n\nAll that being said, I wish many of today's projects were done in animation. I would love it if the MCU movies were animated. Imagine being able to make the characters look exactly like they do in the comics without coming across as awkward, like in some films. Imagine how amazing the Dungeons & Dragons movie would be if it were animated. Or a fully animated series based on the Harry Potter books. I get the commercial side of it, I believe live-actions attract more viewers. But if we consider quality alone, animation is superior in every way, and I don\u2019t understand why people get hyped when something is announced as a live-action adaptation (especially of games). Hollywood has managed to implant this live-action culture, and now people will accept any awkward as long as it's packed with CGI. And I'll go further, maybe my most unpopular opinion of all: as much as I like *The Lord of the Rings* movies, I would love to see an adaptation of the books completely redone in animation.",

Some of these websites are small, struggling to survive on a few ads or a donate button, while the YouTuber making a video based on their work racks up thousands or even millions of views and makes serious money without even so much as a link to the original source.\n\nIt\u2019s kind of ironic, isn\u2019t it? The same creators calling out big streamers for profiting off their content are often doing something very similar\u2014turning other people\u2019s work into profit without giving credit or revenue where it\u2019s due.",

        "text": "I've been playing the co-op recently. \n\nEvery gun feels awful to fire: they look like toys, they're unbearably slow, the damage scaling is off by about 2-3x, the enemies move faster than the bullets do so even if you lead your shots there's still only about a 50% chance they'll hit if you're over 6 feet away (and that goes WAY down if you're using a shotgun), they don't even work a large chunk of the time (I stopped counting the amount of times I have been basically inside an enemy and they have taken no damage despite the hit sounds playing), and decent guns are practically impossible to come by. \n\nThe second wind mechanic was a great idea in theory, but when every enemy in the game sprints away from you as fast as possible the second you get downed, and the accuracy of all guns drops to ~0 over a distance of 2 meters, it makes it basically pointless.\n\nThe only usable characters are Brick and Lilith, the first two we tried were Roland and Mordecai and it was so piss-poor that we literally couldn't continue and had to restart as the other two, who are significantly better and are still offensively bad. \n\nThe landscape is vast and full of absolutely nothing to do, it feels like they made the world but forgot to add any content to it. It is so drawn out, and so, so boring. It could have been 1 map and 10 hours of active gameplay, but instead it is 30 maps and 100 hours of shit. \n\nIt was released in 2009. Bioshock 1, Half-Life 2, Halo 3, several COD games, and loads of other FPS titles had established the conventions we still use years before. Making it function the way it does would have been harder than just making it in a way we already know is fun, and it's not like the variety the guns (are supposed to) have would needed any of that to be reworked. \n\nThe entire game feels like it wasn't built for its own mechanics, it's a mish-mash of ideas that are fun in isolation but somehow they have built in every contradiction there is to make those mechanics as unenjoyable as possible. \n\nIt isn't a good game, my time with it is some of the least fun I have ever had in my life, and I genuinely do not understand how it got released at all, let alone how it got a sequel (no hate to BL2 tho, I quite liked it).

However, that\u2019s also very different from saying sequels suck.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m crossing out Lord of the Rings, probably shouldn\u2019t count. However, I\u2019m adding 4 more franchises \n\nShrek: Shrek 3 and 4 aren\u2019t great, but 2 is arguably better than 1\n\nMission Impossible: the first one is probably considered to be like the 5th best in the franchise.\n\nFast and Furious:  not super familiar with their films, but most seem to rank the first one in somewhere near the middle or even bottom.\n\nBourne: Supremacy and Ultimatum are both better.\n\n\nIf y\u2019all are arguing the original is almost never the worst then fair point, but it doesn\u2019t negate that sequels don\u2019t always suck ",

For the first two minutes, I thought it was pretty good. Such dark lyrics, and a great guitar riff.\n\nUnfortunately, my excitement went away when it got to the \"Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?\" part. I don't remember how I reacted to it, but it really took me out of the song. When the song finally ended, I got confused. Is 'Bohemian Rhapsody' one song? Or three songs? And why did the tone change all of a sudden?\n\nAfter I finished, I never listened to it again. I would hear the song on occasions whether I'd be in an area where music is played on the speakers, or whenever one of my school teachers would play music. As I grew older, I began to not hate it as much, but when I would listen to the song, I would only play the ballad part.\n\nIt's now 2024, and I still only listen to the ballad part (+ the ending \"nothing really matters\" lyrics. 'Cause why not). Funny enough, I've listened to fan-edited versions of the song on YouTube (where it's just the ballad) more than the actual official upload.\n\nBefore anyone comes up with any conclusions, let me settle the deal. Just because I'm not a fan of 'Bohemian Rhapsody'. that doesn't mean I don't like 'Queen'. In fact, one of my favorite songs of all time is a Queen song (It's A Kind Of Magic). I just think that their most popular song is weirdly structured, changes tone too quickly, and it's quite bizarre. This is where I give my props to Queen, as for their Live Aid performance, they only played the ballad. Although, I have to assume that they didn't play the rest of the song because of the time-limit each performer of the concert had.\n\nStrangely, however. I did eventually find the second half of the song to be slightly better when it's performed live. I'm not a fan of the original studio version, but I did find myself like the second half more in life performances, and i guess it's because it feels more like a transition to song, and it has more fan interaction.\n\nAnyways, that is my unpopular opinion.",

The fact that we can process and share complex thoughts doesn\u2019t make us the \u201cbetter\u201d animal, and there\u2019s no such thing as the best animal.

I could somewhat understand (though still not support) if we\u2019re talking about insects, as they\u2019re so vastly different from us, but when you hang a dog, blow up a seagull, or poison a mouse, how can you not feel guilty? They might be smaller, have fur and tails, but they still have two eyes like ours, two ears to listen, and red blood running through their veins. How does it not occur to you to think, \u201cwhat if they did that to me?\u201d\nThere are so many different studies proving that animals can demonstrate empathy (even across different species), have brain structures that allow them to experience suffering just like we do, and YET many people still think that every living being other than Homo sapiens sapiens is devoid of reason? I\u2019ve read articles analyzing how species of cetaceans, birds, and many mammals communicate with each other by giving themselves names, about pure acts of altruism to save each other, and even collaboration between entirely different species.

For clarity and elaboration, I know that governors to mandate a cars speed exist, but I am advocating for this effect to be not optional but mandatory for every road vehicle, ideally manufactured in such a way where removal or tampering results in failure of the engine. Any race vehicle without one should be limited to the tracks only. \n\nPeople seem to be interpreting this as me trying to prevent people from speeding? No where in my post did I say that. With a cap of 100 miles an hour people can still speed in pretty much every existing zone. That\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying at all. I am trying to make the point that the capability of going upwards of 120 mph *on any public stretch of road in the world* is absolutely not worth its weight in fun or freedom to any probable risk, nor can I name one emergency where it\u2019s validated either. \n\nI honestly don\u2019t give a shit about \u201cWaaaah what about the autobahn or this one really remote road in Texas/Australia?\u201d I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that the autobahn to car junkies is the equivalent palm-fantasy of going to Amsterdam to potheads.

So, instead of going on the grocery store and loading up for a family of four once a week, you swing by the grocery store on the way home from work and grab something for dinner. It also allows food to be fresher and generally of higher quality since you aren't having to stock up for a week or two.\n\nAlso, the definition of a walkable community is that schools are of walkable distance OR connected by transportation. \n\nBut also, professional city/urban planners seem to idiotically fundamentally misunderstand walkable communities. In Texas at least their definition is a bunch of expensive apartments with high priced restaurants and bars underneath. Which... cool... but that isn't walkable if you still have to drive 30 minutes to a grocery store or to school or to entertainment or to recreation.\n\nAlso many of these walkable communities seem to be designed to be as hot as possible, big cement buildings, huge parking lots, zero trees. Just by eliminating giant flat fields of cement and making sure walkways were adequately shaded, a-lot of summer heat can be mitigated. \n\nBut it seems alot of Americans, and architects/city planners/urban planners, have zero idea what they are talking about in regards to walkable communities.",

However, you can opt out of donating your own tissue/organs if you want.\n\nI believe that if you specifically opt out of donating an organ when you die, you shouldn't be allowed to recieve one from a stranger. For example, if you opt out of donating your kidneys when you die, the government should prioritise giving kidneys to people who are willing to donate their own instead of you in case of emergency.\n\nOf course, if there were no donors who needed organs, then you can give them to the non-donors. But that's a useless thing to consider, as there will always be more people who need organs than organs themselves. You could just consider my opinion to be putting non-donors at the bottom of the list, but they'll never make it to the top of that list anyway.\n\nI'd definitely also allow people donating organs to science to recieve them. Either way, you're donating your organs to potentially save other lives.\n\nThe entire idea of nationalised healthcare is that everyone puts a little in, and then you can take a little out if you need it. This should also apply to organs.",

Consequently, for whatever reason you might think of, sweat evaporates from my armpits more quickly \n\nTo be fair, I find armpit hair to be especially disgusting.  It's thin and strangly and has the appearance of an unkempt dead rat\n\nApparently, someone that swings their arms a lot when they walk can suffer from greater irritation if they shave their arms, but arm swinging while walking is a different topic \n\nIn my opinion, it can be acceptable for someone to trim their armpit hair.  I guess that's okay, but that should be the bare minimum that everyone should do",

A slow, agonising death that takes well over 2 weeks. Starvation doesn't seem that painful because most of us in 1st world countries would generally never go for more than a whole day without food. But if you were on your last few days before dying from starvation, you would feel the *extreme* pain of your body slowly eating itself alive. You might even try to eat your own hands- it's surprising what the human brain is willing to make you do for survival. \n\nIf I were locked in a cupboard and left to starve to death, I'd pray and hope that dehydration kills me first. Dehydration is also painful but at least it only takes 4 days max if you stopped drinking water!\n\nUpdate: Why did this post get so much attention?",

        "text": "So, I've been job hunting for three months now, and it's been really hard on me. So, far I've had four interviews, and since I live with my parents I don't have any expenses, I shouldn't be complaining, but I am. Interviews take a long time to prepare, every single one of those interviews I had to shave and really prepare myself mentally. Like getting prepared dress wise for an interview can just be exhausting task, and a lot of times that labor isn't even recognized.   Out of four of the interviews I got rejected from two of them and the other two are pending. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, since the company is taking soo much of your time for an interview, as preparation and if any of you have read some of the stories from r/recruitinghell, you would know it's not easy to to get a job and some of those stories are just downright frightening. Also getting to the interview stage is itself an accomplishment, as there are soo many ghosting and rejections.  I've applied to nearly 50 jobs and I still am unemployed. It would be nice if I were to get financial recompensation for interviewing as in that's the whole purpose of getting a job. In some cases the money spent on the interview such as attire and transportation would still surpass the payment from the interview as some people would spend probably over $100 just for a suit and tie and maybe another $50 for transportation, meaning a $50 check would still be better than nothing. For those people saying \"it's my job to present myself as best as possible, and it's not the job for the company to care\" the company  can reject whom ever they want before the interview, just based on the resume and the cover letter and that's happened to me soo many times. \n\nAdditionally some interviewers don't represent the company well, the last one just gave me a tour and didn't ask qualitative questions if the interviewee was getting paid they would have take that time more seriously. Now to be fair some interviewers are fair, but they're just HR representatives that know jack shit about the position. In my humble opinion it would be more practical to make the boss better at interviewing than make HR representatives be more knowledgeable of how to recruit people for positions that they know nothing about. Sorry about that tangent.  Out of all four of the interviews I actually only had one interview where the people knew how to interview and they knew what the job entailed and I got rejected from this job.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLong story short, I'd feel a bit more respected and valued if I were to get paid. We unfortunately live in a society where the corporations and the owner class can do whatever they want, with the addition of the culture and the media being submissive to that. I mean if I can't get the job, I should at least be recognized for the effort that I made for getting to the job, as in I every single time I get rejected while having been in an interview it's an awful kind of feeling. I also would like to be getting some form of money for my troubles.",

Yes, it's free, but basically what you're doing when you open an account is giving someone else your money to \"use\" for their own business. This is why I believe banks should be operated without the need for extra funds because they're already taking everyone else's money to begin with, but it's not like they can just magically say there's more in existence because of the \"gold standard\" right? Oh, wait... They can do that, but that would require the government to do a tiny amount more work where they already do none. Fiat money imo is a way of just keeping the poor poor, but I digress.\n\nThe reality of the matter is, is the money doesn't even really exist because money is only money because a government said it is. So there's realistically no reason for the banks to \"need\" to make money if the government would actually be helpful for once and give them the resources to be non-profit. Technically speaking the government could print more money to specifically put in banks, and just \"decree\" that it is legal tender. \n\nBut, asking for non-profit necessary services in the USA is basically asking for way too much, even though other countries can do similar things with next to no issue... Perks of being American, where you can see so many things that can be improved for the rest of society yet you can't do shit because you've been kept in poverty through no fault of your own!\n\nEdit: Not really sure how this gained so much traction.

Being ugly doesn't mean that you are unpleaseant to be around or that you are an idiot or anything like that, it just means that most people wouldn't want to be with you romantically or sexually. I don't believe a person needs to have an active romantic or sexual life to be happy and have a fulfilling life, so whatever. \n\nI think it makes it easier to make friends too. I'm not a threat to my female friends, and I am not an object of desire for my male friends. Sure, some people are assholes, but these aren't people worthy of attention anyway. \n\nOverall, I don't think it is that bad to be ugly, and whenever someone tries to insult another person calling them that I think it is pretty stupid.

        "text": "Before y\u2019all hop into the comments telling me how wrong I am, let me explain my argument. I am NOT saying that your travel experiences make you unattractive. I\u2019m not even saying that liking to travel is bad.\n\nWhat I AM saying is that many women on dating apps (I\u2019m not sure if this is sex-specific, do men do this too?) have travel all over their profiles. Pictures of themselves kayaking in the jungle. Pictures of themselves in front of the Great Pyramids. And so forth. And then you read through their profile, and they say their biggest hobbies and goals involve travel. That they took a year off work to travel the world. That they\u2019re looking for a travel partner, and so forth.\n\nSo anyway. If that\u2019s legitimately what you truly love and that\u2019s a big part of your personality, more power to you. But I can\u2019t help but wonder if you\u2019re doing/saying all this because you think it\u2019s attractive or it makes you interesting. Because it doesn\u2019t IMO.\n\nHonestly, if I see someone who seems obsessed with travel, it\u2019s kind of a red flag. Traveling is fun for sure, but I don\u2019t want a \u201ctravel partner.\u201d I want a wife. I want to settle down and have children. And I know I\u2019m not the only one. I also want someone who\u2019s responsible with money, not someone who\u2019s going to blow all of our life savings to go to Paris. I\u2019d rather save that money to send out future children to a private school, or save it for retirement when we actually CAN travel without having to lose our jobs\u2014because we don\u2019t have jobs anymore.\n\nI dunno. Maybe that makes me boring. But your obsession with travel and being willing to risk losing your job to go on a year long African safari just seems irresponsible to me, and that\u2019s kind of unattractive to me. But that\u2019s just me. It also sounds exhausting, both mentally and physically. ",

Unless you have a specific allergy, spicy food doesn't make you ill, the amount you're jamming down your gullet does.  Which leads me to my next point. \n\nAlmost everything on the menu at  Taco Bell can be ordered with grilled chicken instead of admittedly greasy ground beef.  Then it's topped with lettuce and tomato.  If you went home, grilled some chicken and served it with fresh chopped lettuce and tomato, you'd say you made a healthy meal, but for some reason because it comes in a paper bag we hate it.  \n\nNow where I think people go wrong is how MUCH they order.  Taco Bell has the blessing and curse of being exceptionally cheap.   However, the average 10 dollar meal box you can order pre set is 1000 calories or less.  Not great, but have water instead of soda, again, go for chicken instead of beef, decent meal.  It's when you order the box.  Plus an extra couple of tacos, plus another crunch wrap, plus the weird burrito they have ads for (there's only so many ways you can toast a burrito folks, stop trying to be fancy), then try to eat this all at once, then wonder why you're sweating and your stomach hurts.

Borough Market had insane quality produce that you simply cannot find easily in the U.S.   So many stands in the market selling top tier quality coffee, pastries, breads, etc.  Now I know the automatic reply will be \u2018those aren\u2019t British foods!\u2019, but even the British specific foods thoroughly enjoyable there.  So many wonderful English style cheeses.  Scones with British clotted cream and jams made in the UK were to die for.  Full English breakfasts with blood pudding, sausages, and even the beans were delicious.  They even take way more consideration into the type of cut they use for bacon.  So many other British foods were amazing from the meat pies to the pub foods we had tried.  And no, this wasn\u2019t just in London, we traveled all throughout the countryside, to Bath and Oxford too and had great food everywhere.  I really think the Brits have stepped up their food game. Even their traditional foods they often get made fun of for were superbly good and delicious at many places. Desserts and pastries were just in a whole different level. The Brits definitely spare no calories due to worry over fat, lol.   British food = bad is now an outdated stereotype.  \n\n\nAnd yes, I used UK/British/England interchangeably in this post because I\u2019m a dumb American and don\u2019t care.

The only reason to get a promise ring is because one partner really wants the commitment but the other doesn\u2019t, so they buy a ring to appease them. This fundamental disconnect is almost always a death sentence for any relationship. Good luck explaining the promise ring to your family.\n\nI know of 5 couples that gave each other promise rings. None of them ended up married. \n\nThe first ring you should buy for a significant other is an engagement/wedding ring. \n\nP.S. Purity rings are also weird.",

My neighbour got married at 31 lived with his parents and wife till he was 41 rent free. Worked 2 jobs while his parents took care of his children. He saved enough money to build a large house on a farm. My dad never moved out of his parents house. when he immigrated to Canada he built a 9 bed 7 bath together with his parents. They got married my mother moved in. Culturally I'm expected to not me out as I'm an only child it would be frowned upon if I moved out and rented a place. Unless I went to work in a different city. Most people of other cultures such as hispanics Asians arabs find it very cool and amazing that my dad lives with his parents while white Americans/ canadians. Make fun of him. Generally in my culture and most others. If your not married and live/work in the same city you should live with your parents untill you get married (It would be okay to move out after collage if your parents lived in a 3 bedroom townhouse and you have 5 brothers). While living at your parents you shouldn't pay any rent and save atleast half of your salary so once you get married you can purchase your own house. my moms co worker is 52 he lives in his mothers basement with his wife and kids. In a suit most people in the culture would say why the hell would he move and and rent his own place if he can't afford to purchase. Why would you want to live in some one else's basement instead of your own parents basement. I'm not here to judge anyone's culture or way of life everyone has their choice but it just bothers me how living with your parents is frowned upon and seen as better to move out and rent some one else's house rather then live at home!? \n",

I was expecting it to be this terrible, super complicated thing, because I always heard everyone complaining about it (\"it\" being wait time in lines and having to take everything off. SPECIFICALLY THAT PART IS WHAT THIS OPINION IS ABOUT, NOT ANY OUTSIDE CIRCUMSTANCES). Really, it was just a matter of finding where the map was (which is very easy to do, because they have maps everywhere in the main terminal areas), and a lot of waiting in line. The security wasn't even as complicated as people make it seem, it's just putting your stuff in buckets and taking an extra 45 seconds to walk through a detector. As long as you have all of the stuff you need (ID and plane ticket) ready with you, and as long as you don't have anything you can't legally bring on the flight, the biggest \"issue\" is just lines. And if you make sure to get there with time to spare, lines making you late doesn't have to be anything close to a worry.\n\nSo, in my opinion, people who make a big fuss about airports and security are just being dramatic because they're impatient or have poor time management and always get there late.\n\nEDITED FOR CLARITY: I had intended for this post to target people who solely bitch about all of the waiting in line and having to take all their stuff off. Entirely my fault for not specifying that originally. Obviously a special case is a special case, and there's a shit ton of other issues with the system. The specific part of the subject my opinion is mainly related to is when someone goes, \"I was at the airport 2 hours early and the lines still almost made me late! \\*surprised Pikachu face here\\*\" like that's surprising or, \"oh my god I STILL had to take off all my stuff at the airport like everyone always talks about and expects!\"  \n\n\n2nd Edit: I'm appreciating a lot of the discussions this post is spawning. Genuine thanks to the people who aren't just trying to cuss me out lol",

        "text": "To start, id just like to say that I know working a 9-5 has its downsides, and it\u2019s often incredibly stressful for a lot of people. Every job is difficult to some capacity - if you wouldn\u2019t do it for free, then it\u2019s hard. No one likes work, unless you\u2019re one of the 1% who managed to find a job doing something you love. I am not trying to make anyone\u2019s suffering seem insignificant. I\u2019m trying to offer perspective.\n\nI have started to notice a trend amongst both the people I know who work office jobs, as well as on here. This idea that working a 9-5 is \u2018literal hell\u2019 and \u2018inhumane\u2019. \n\nI simply do not understand.\n\nWorking as a kitchen manager, I spent at least 40 hrs/wk standing in a 45+ degree (celsius) kitchen, with no air conditioning, no ventilation other than the smoke extraction fans, wearing fire/grease-proof pants, an apron, grease-proof boots, and gloves. I spent an additional 15-20 hrs/wk prepping, cleaning, ordering ingredients, having meetings, fixing shit that broke, rostering shifts, and dealing with incident reports, as well as being a part-time pseudo-accountant for the owner. I know many other kitchen workers who\u2019s lives are unbelievably hard, much harder than mine.\n\nWhen I was a drillers Offsider (reverse circulation), THAT was close to hell. To those of you who know what being an RC drillers Offsider entails, you know exactly what I mean. Your standard uniform is long hi-vis pants, a long sleeve hi-vis shirt, thick gloves, thick socks, steel toe boots, a neck-sleeve, safety glasses, and a hard hat. You\u2019re working in often 50+ celsius heat, in the middle of the West Australian desert, for 12-14 hours per day, for between 2-4 weeks in a row, with about 1-2 weeks off rotation. Winter is often minus 5-10ish. The job, at its most basic, is sprinting (and I mean sprinting) back and forth, organising/carrying 30kg-70kg bags of dirt and mud, all day every day. You work with drug addicts, ex-felons, and often with people who are extremely low-IQ (not most, but some). Every day is waking up at 3:30am, start at 4am, back to camp by 5pm, repeat.\n\nWorking as a bartender, I spend 40hrs per week living in the night time. Most people wouldn\u2019t believe how bad the sleep schedule for the average bartender is. I sleep during the day, even on my days off (Sunday and Monday), and in total I probably sleep about 40hrs/wk. I have been in fights, called the police at least once a week every week, been threatened with needles, seen people been glassed, and been sexually harassed/assaulted many times. I once had to help a 13 year old girl who was drugged and nearly raped, called the ambos and her parents. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to post about how \u2018tough\u2019 I am, or how \u2018hard\u2019 my life is. I\u2019m trying to understand why people think that 9-5 work is difficult. The friends I have who are in \u2018entry level\u2019 office jobs get paid ~$75k/yr, sit in air conditioned offices, wake up at a gorgeous 6-7am, have regular schedules (which I am unbelievably envious of), and have weekends free. I, and many I know, get paid half of that, and easily work just as hard if not harder.\n\nFrom my point of view, the 9-5 life is a dream I, and a lot of people I know, deeply envy. It\u2019s not hell. To many I know, it seems like paradise.\n\nEdit: I would just like to say, thank you all for the responses, both positive and negative. I understand this is quite an unpopular opinion (hence the subreddit), and I\u2019m glad the discourse was relatively civil. I\u2019ve seen about 50/50 positive to negative replies. Not that I\u2019m keeping score.\n\nI would also like to say: I made this post in a very different state of mind that I am in now. I posted this when I was quite angry, at 2:30am after a late bartending shift (and after a few drinks, not that that\u2019s an excuse). If I had known it would blow up like this, I would have worded it very differently. I still hold my opinion, however, I will concede that I took it too far with my own personal comparisons; comparing my life to others is, and always will be, a totally false equivalence. I made this post as a rant, and it came out very aggressive and accusatory, and hence inflammatory. I apologise for that, genuinely. \n\nIf I could clarify it further without adding my own personal bullshit into it, it would be as such - I think the hyperbole of describing a 9-5, specifically an office job, as \u2018literal hell\u2019, and \u2018inhumane\u2019, the *vast* majority of the time, is totally absurd. Life, as a general rule, is really fucking hard for everyone. But the fact that some things are harder, and objectively worse, than other things, does not invalidate others experiences. \n\nI would, and I know just about every person on this planet, would rather work in an office bored out of their mind, than work in a cobalt mine, or be drafted into a war. Let alone most general labour jobs or hospitality/kitchen jobs. \n\nThis isn\u2019t a \u2018quit yer yappin\u2019 post. You\u2019re allowed to hate your job and complain. But the ridiculous notion that your 9-5 office job is somehow a violation of human rights is downright disgusting. ",

You have to text all day, everyday, emidiatly, good morning and good night texts, keep track of who texted first last time, who does it more often,. If you are busy, then you apparently is a red flag because all your time and thoughts has to revovlve about the person you just meet. \n\nWe need to slow the fuck down and give each other space to breath and get to know each other in a more down to earth kind of way. \n\nI got text anxiety because of all the stuff that expected of you through that god damk phone, and if you text something the other person find  little wierd, you get ghosted. \nAnd its so easy to miscommunicate through text.\n\nWe are making it way harder than it needs to be to date in the 21'st century. \n\n\nEdit: its hilarious how many of you are focusing only on my spelling mistakes. Actually sad so many judge somebody on their ability to spell correctly . \n\nI will forever spell immediately as emidiatly, just out of spite. \n\nAnd remember , not all on the internet has English as their first language.

        "text": "This movie is pretty much like a pilot for a TV series. I'd say, even worse.\n\nThe first act was long... long, it just doesn't end. I was almost going to leave the cinema, because it refused to go anywhere. Then, it suddenly explodes, and lots of unconsequential things happen one after the next, just to keep the energy high. And that's the only reason this happens, because I'm sure we won't be seeing half of the things that were shown in the movie until this point in the next movie. Because it's clear that they will make multiple movies for this series.\n\nThe overal thread between all these \"happenings\" is the multiverse stuff, but I still find it a very weak thread. It requires you to *love* Marvel movies, and by proxy to accept that they have spent all their ideas and require bringing up the concept of time and multiverse travel in order to keep things interesting. If you've been around long enough in this world, you'd know by know that is the first signal that they're desperate to milk a dead cow into annihilation.\n\nThat's one thing. The other one is that you're constantly presented with an undefinite amount of plot points that never get solved. First, you're presented with The Spot, which becomes extremely powerful... and then no one speaks of him again. Then, Miguel O'Hara is another sort of Villain, and he should be the true villain of the movie... except this is also interrupted only to end the movie with the protagonist ending up in another universe where you're shown ANOTHER VILLAIN in the last 5 minutes, and the movie ends there.\n\nThis movie is constantly presenting you mcguffin after mcguffin, plot elements hanging loose just to let them... hang lose like that. The main issue with this pretend movie is that you paid a ticket to see a gigantic trailer for the next 3 movies. If you want to get the whole of your ticket's worth, you HAVE to watch the next movies as well, because the time you spent watching this one alone is pointless, worthless. The entire movie is a cliffhanger, with an incredibly furstrating and unsatisfactory edging. A movie whose only reason is to create hype for the next movies.\n\nYou didn't watch a movie, but *the promise of a good movie*. That doesn't sit well with me at all. It's like a videogame with stupid microtransactions: it's implicit that I won't get back my money's worth unless I spend other money just to have a remotely satisfactory experience.\n\nHollywood is trying to milk the audience dry, and they won't be satisfied until ALL MOVIES at the cinema are precisely like that. I think the age of endless franchises has to come to an end.\n\nEDIT:  \nI wish there was a way to differentiate those who agree with me vs those who disagree with me between the upvotes. It would be interesting, it's probably 50/50.\n\nEDIT2:\n\n***Gwen is the true main character. Miles and Gwen have satisfying character arcs:***\n\nIt doesn't stand up for the simple reason that Miles gets all of the main conflicts in the whole movie. All the anthagonists have beef with him, not with Gwen. On top of that, he gets the majority of screentime compared to her. So, she's a main character, but a secondary one. Miles is still the protagonist of the movie.\n\nOn top of that, as I wrote somewhere else, her conflict is barely touched upon and it's started and resolved in just two scenes. One at the very beginning, one at the very end. Her father goes from wanting to arrest her, to having changed his mind, and in the middle of that there's a whole lot of nothing if not the occasional \"dad hates me\". And that's that. That's the character development and your resolution. Two scenes, about 6 minutes in total? Maybe even less. Meanwhile, Miles' family relationship gets a good chunk of the focus in the first act's runtime. And what we get as a resolution is him changing his mind about keeping his identity a secret at the very end of the movie.\n\nMoreover, These:  \n*-Gwen is in conflict with her father at the beginning, they make peace by the end.*  \n*-Miles wants to keep his identity a secret, but then changes his mind by the end.*\n\n...these are Ideas, not character arcs. I could do the same with The Lord of The Rings:  \n*-Legolas hates dwarves at the beginning of the saga. He doesn't hate them anymore and befriends one by the end.*\n\nThat's an idea. What matters more than anything is the execution. Rememember that spanish miss who ruined the Jesus murale of her local church? The intention was to restore a painting of the Christ, but we don't judge the outcome of her efforts by the idea, or the intention. We judge the execution, and her execution was awful.\n\nTo me, the same goes with this movie. Of course, we're talking about extremely competent people in this case.\n\nWhat about the other events? One villain is presented, and then disappears mid movie. The Mumbattan moment exists pretty much in a vacuum to justify Spot getting higher powers. Then, O'Hara is revealed to be an anthagonist/villain. Chase scene. Then, another anthagonist/villain still, shown during the last 10 minutes (even less) of the movie. I find the whole thing extremely weak, you're constantly dished new stuff, moment after moment. It's filled to the brim with fan-service and references, it's chock-full of new stuff that is constantly poured in and neither the chracters nor the plot are ever fleshed out at all.\n\nBear this in mind: you know Gwen emotionally from the first movie, but to know her backstory you need a *very quick* summary of her life at the beginning of ATSV. They get rid of her backstory in about 5 minutes. Almost as an afterthought.",

When I wanted to exit, he realized he was blocking my way and uttered, \"sorry, beautiful,\" which caught me off guard. My boyfriend often asserts that I'm the most beautiful girl he's ever met, but he says it out of love.\n\nI guess because of the way I was raised I don\u2019t believe I am good looking. But I know that is the case with many people So!\n\n if no one told you this today\u2026.\n\nI am here to say that ***you are beautiful***, sometimes we can be in settings where we are considered ugly.

Besides, the modern sedentary lifestyle is not very fitness friendly.\n\nIf you stay reasonably fit, active and injury free, then your body won't really start breaking down until your 60s \u2013 if even that! \n\nSo, all in all, 30s and 40s are actually the prime of your life, as you have the happy medium between fitness, mental maturity and wisdom.\n\nConsidering oneself old in one's 30s and 40s is a defeatist mentality.\n\nBefore you assume that I am some middle aged person going on a rant; let me tell you that I am not.\nI am 22, and I've seen firsthand how people's lives get better and more fulfilling in their 30s and 40s \u2013 especially if they look after their health.\n\nSo, it bothers me when people get in this defeatist mindset.",

Those networks will pay \"content creators\" for views and not for quality. Therefore, almost everything people read or watch when they mindlessly surf the web is fake content, staged videos, fake clickbaity information, photoshopped/filtered people dancing in skimpy outfits, and/or rage-bait videos. Good content doesn't last - social media websites tend to remove older videos from our feed regardless of their quality, so the creators always have to come up with new videos or posts, they keep repeating the tricks that got them views for their older videos, which means that you can see the same staged argument or stupid dance, again and again, coming from the same creators. We have entered a dark age of information, and the entertainment the masses consume is little better than what an illiterate potato peasant would've gotten back when people blamed witches for bad harvests.",

A lot of people don\u2019t realize that charisma is built from accepting you who are and having the strength to face and defeat rejection. This is an immensely attractive quality in a person and I believe that when an approach is done tastefully, in the right environment and at the right time, it contributes to the initial attraction.\n\nIn the online world, this element of dating is removed and almost makes the process too easy, and it becomes more of a process of \u201cselling\u201d who you are.\n\nI understand that this might not be an unpopular opinion for boomers and millennials, but beleive it is with gen z\n\nEdit: however you like getting dates, best of luck to you and keep putting yourself out there! Online dating might be the way to go for some of you folks, don\u2019t be afraid to put yourself out there and keep trying! Just be yourself\n\nEdit #2: I just want to say that I\u2019m not defining approaching as \u201chey girl ur hot let\u2019s bang\u201d I\u2019m saying lf you are in a public place and someone makes eye contact with you and smiles at you( and it\u2019s genuine) just start the most casual harmless conversation. You aren\u2019t gonna get put in a TikTok trying to label you as a creepy weirdo and have your whole reputation destroyed overnight. If the younger generation has deemed making casual conversation with someone you don\u2019t know as *always* weird or creepy ( I understand there are exceptions), then I feel bad for you guys. Some of the most fun experiences I had in life were because a met a new friend that I just chatted up one day. ",

I always worked hard in school but I never really had an idea what it meant until I started working in the real world. Kids at 16-18 do not have the perspective to make the best decisions for their future. There needs to be an alternative instead of straight to college where children should work in different jobs before committing straight to future education, sort of like mandatory conscription service but not exactly. \n\nThe whole system is ridiculous honestly, there really needs to be reform right now, more discussion.",

        "text": "Dogs are great and wonderful additions to the family, but they are in no way a direct substitute for human relationships. When asked why they love dogs so much, some people tout that dogs will love you unconditionally, don\u2019t care about who you are or how much money you have, and will be there for you during your hardest times.\n\nThe thing is that dogs don\u2019t have a choice whether to be there for you or not. They are animals that live in your home and depend on you for all of their basic needs. They have no concept of money or morals, if you treat them well they will probably love you. \n\nA relationship with a dog is a beautiful thing but in no way is it more important than a relationship with other people. The thing about unconditional love is that the dog will love you even if you are a crappy person. In contrast, a person that sees your flaws and your issues and knows you inside and out, and still chooses to love you is the most beautiful thing in the world. Unconditional love between two people is probably not a healthy thing. If your best friend does crappy things and treats you poorly, you can and should stop loving and supporting that person.\n\nLet\u2019s stop treating dogs as if they\u2019re perfect little angels that are here to fulfill our emotional needs. Remember that they\u2019re animals; treat them as such and seek out meaningful connections with real people.\n\nTLDR: dogs and other animals are great but are in no way morally superior to people for loving you unconditionally. \n\nAlso, I\u2019m not talking about service animals or ESA either.. just purely pet dogs.",

ALL bagless vacuum cleaners are junk!\n\nEdit: thanks for proving that the majority has no idea how a vacuum cleaner works. If you do a YouTube search you'll find a channel run by a vacuum repair/dealer owner who explains why they're horrible, cheaply made and overpriced with Dyson and shark being on the top of that list.

I've been forced to use one in a commercial setting and had to switch to a commercial vac which BTW most if not all commercial vacs are bagged because the bagless ones clog up too fast to be useful in a commercial setting. \n\n\nFinal Edit: if some of you still don't believe me, check out this video on why Shark vacuums are some of the worst designed vacuums ever. you laugh at us nerds but we prove you wrong with science. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4OIEz5z7Ag",

I mostly have an ocular aura so intense that I can't see at all, and will projectile vomit.

It's a completely different condition that happens to INCLUDE a very strong headache.

These people are completely goddamned clueless and the \"work\" they do is straight up unethical because of it.\n\nThey are little more than college students with a major in PE. They have very little training themselves and have probably been trained by individuals who are just as clueless. It makes some sense when you understand that their primary role at the gym isn't to educate the members, it's to generate sales for the company.\n\nThey don't know what a good workout program is and don't know what good technique is either. I see it all the time. Personal trainers standing by a customer doing squats or deadlifts with horrible technique and the trainer not only doesn't correct them, but they congratulate them on the reps and tell them to add more weight to the bar.\n\nTo the credit of everyone involved, I'd say fitness is a topic that is extremely difficult to educate oneself properly on, as there's a ton of shitty information out there, but one favor you can do yourself is don't bother paying money for a personal trainer at a commercial gym.",

Especially Rohrschach's depiction gains so much more depth, turning from the stereotype of the self-righteous vigilant lunatic from the comics to an actual ambivalent character through which the film poses the question of what price to pay for sticking to one's moral principles in a deeply corrupt world.

Whenever you read an AITAH people always believe the person telling the story. There's no curiosity among the readers and their advice is always to go nuclear.\r  \n\r  \nI've already picked up on some ways writers will lie to the reader to fool them to be on their side. For example no one ever \"Snoops\". In their stories it's always the most thin story ever like \"We went to a concert in 2013 and I wanted to check the date so I went through his emails\" or \"I was looking for a photo of my dog so I read his DMs\".\r  \n\r  \nI've actually seen people say \"I was feeling insecure so I snooped\" and they get lit up by Redditors so naturally people lie. There's also no taking the story with a grain of salt or a bit of \"I'd like to hear his/her side of the story because this doesn't make sense\"\r  \n\r  \nAlso the \"get therapy\" advice is nauseating. Therapy isn't some magic bullet that makes everything better or \"fixes\" you. It's something to help you develop coping mechanisms. Not everyone needs therapy for every time they stub their toe. This is such a childish way of looking at real life problems.\r  \n\r  \nThe moral of the story is it's better to find friends who have some life experience and have been in tough positions to help you navigate them instead of a bunch of strangers on here.",

Everyone is telling everyone to go into IT, learn to code. Computer Science became one of the most sought after degrees. \n\nNow come 2024. Everyone and their dog knows how to code. Everyone's cousin is in compsci, there's a massive layoff in tech and everything is getting outsourced to India to South America where code is code, it doesn't care what country it's from. \n\nToday, the same thing that happened to IT in the 2010s is happening to trades. Everyone and their aunt is telling youngster to go into trades because \"it pays a lot of money\". Because \"there's a shortage\". Once again we see the same long waitlist in school, in apprenticeships and the shortage for competent workmen. \n\nWhat that means is in 10-15 years, we are once again going to see the same thing that happened to IT happen to trades. We are gonna have way too many tradesmen and not enough jobs. \n\nWhen that happens the trades apocalypse will come. \n\nTo go even further, the rise of mechatronics and large scale prefab will reduce the labour requirement for a lot of work in the future. They don't need to create a robot that can build it in the field when they can create a robot that can build most of the components in a factory and have a few installer just assemble it like legoes. Big slash in labour cost. \n\nYes we will always still need tradesmen but the 6 figure tradesman is an anomaly, not the norm. Ask any tradesmen over 50 if being in the trade has always been glamorous. ",

Fight scenes being a long as they are in a John Wick film aren't essential to the plot. Half the scenes in comedies aren't essential to the plot.

Maybe unnecessarily high sugar in soda is mainly a US thing, but I'd much rather have an Italian soda or a sparkling water with orange or lemon juice squeezed in than anything from American Fanta for instance.  Colas and Root Beers are the only sodas in my opinion where the sugar content makes sense.\n\nAnother thing is the high amount of added sugar in juices and juice drinks.  It's almost all added sugar unless you get pure Grape or pure Orange juice which is extremely expensive now.  And if you order one of the flavored lemonade options at restaurants, it's usually so sweet it's practically undrinkable.  Just stopped at Charlie's Cheesesteaks (which is a cheese steak chain in US malls) and was appalled by how sickeningly sweet their blueberry lemonade was.  Most lemonades at chain restaurants are ridiculously sweet, but this was beyond the pale.  I couldn't even finish it.\n\n",

        "text": "There seems to be 0 discipline from schools for legitimately dangerous students.\n\nStudents who get into fights often or assault teachers at any point have no place in the general population of students trying to actually learn. Back in the day, the school would inform the parents and the parents would handle it knowing if they didn't their child would get expelled and that would be a pain to deal with on top of the embarrassment. Now most parents have 0 desire to control or raise their children and let them run rampant expecting the school to deal with them because there is no consequences for the parent.\n\nYou can provide all the resources and support you want but by the time a child has hit 16-17 years old they need to be able to be a civilized person and not an animal or phone zombie in the classroom. \"No child left behind\" should also apply to the children who show up on time and ready to learn everyday but have to deal with teacher shortages and general educational decline while the school system tries to accommodate these students who have no desire to learn or do well and only show up because they're legally required to. \n\nIn addition to this, students should be allowed to flunk out of school. These days it's almost impossible not wind up with a high school diploma. Graduation should be an accomplishment, not a expectation. It should represent 4 years of hard work and learning, not simply showing up most days. By dumbing down the curriculums and extending endless grace periods and make ups to students who sit on tik tok all day and never do their home work, you help no one.\n\nIt's important to give support to students who have learning difficulties or other problems out of their control, but not students with attitude / behavioral problems. They need to learn that the world isn't accommodating to the unmotivated, rude, and lazy, and maybe they'd become more motivated if they knew they could actually fail. ",

Obviously decimals have legitimate applications in the real world, but that's not what I'm talking about here.\n\nEDIT 2:\nThink about it. If somebody is willing to hide a 100 scale inside of a 10 scale, what else are they hiding??? Just like people whose first and last name is two different first names, ya can't trust em.",

However, it is incredibly difficult to follow the puck on TV and you really have no idea what's going on. It gives me a headache. Thoughts?\n\nEdit - A lot of people are saying baseball is the worst to watch on TV, definitely has an argument, but I think specifically during the postseason a lot of people enjoy watching baseball \n\nEdit 2 - A very good argument can be made for Golf being the worst to watch on TV, but i think a lot of that is how they set up the cameras. It is very difficult to watch your favorite golfer during a tournament. You have to create super fans in order to have a vast following in my opinion. ",

I barely know you.. it\u2019s so ridiculous how these types of people are now the leaders for the dating community. \n\nInfluencers killed critical thinking and basic social etiquette.

Obviously we chatted for like half an hour, but after that it naturally became silent. I like being a passenger in a car, I like looking out the window and daydreaming. One of my friends on the other hand was having none of it. He constantly had to say something every 10 seconds like \"oh, look at the colour of that car \", \"wow, look at those gas prices, they really are high these days\" or \"the weather today is really nice, although it could be a bit warmer\". Sometimes he even said \"wow haha I'm the only one trying to break the silence\". To me this was really annoying. As I said, I like being lost in my own thoughts, which doesn't mean that I don't like talking to people. But you obviously can't talk through a 3 hour car ride. I felt like his comments not only annoyed the living hell out of me, but also made the trip so much more annoying. Please, if you are one of those people that are uncomfortable when everyone is silent, bring a book with yourself, or find something else you can do that takes your mind off of it. Some of us enjoy silence and are annoyed by your attempt to constantly try to break it.\n\nEdit: I feel like I have to emphasise this one more time. It is NOT \"having a conversation\" that I have a problem with. If we have something to talk about, I'll gladly speak with my friends. It doesn't even have to be something interesting. Sometimes we joke around, without any real meaning or depth to something and that is fun as hell. But sometimes people just sit in silence. And even then, you can talk to them. If you have something on your mind, or you want to spark a conversation about something talk to me, I'm all ears. But if you talk to me SOLELY just to avoid silence, you are going to annoy me.

So its similar as the only child who doesn't have a play friend except the child is rejected instead. The parents and other adults get bored of being parents or family members have already been there done that for important milestones and events. and a lot of times the youngest gets the worst parts of their parents marriage. Also the oldest children usually get more help as they are older because once the youngest is finally 18 they feel like they are finally done with dealing with children.\n\nThe older children have a sort of jealousy that the youngest gets to do things that they could have never done but most of the time it's just because parents don't feel like parenting. They are tired its easier and faster if the parent just does it. Or they just don't feel like going through the effort if actually teaching them what to do so they just do it for them. And then once they are adults they just expect them to do it on their own. And then compare them to the older children.\n\n\n\nEdit: I think there definitely are struggles for everyone. Not trying to discredit anyones struggles. Also there is no way that every family will have the same experience. I just always see people being jealous of their youngest siblings and talking about how much harder their lives are because of them. And nobody seems to talk about what it's like being the youngest.

The park may even be able to offer greater access to fast pass users since there are fewer of them.\n\nI frequently go to parks from both Disney and Universal, both with and without the skip the line option, and have noticed a stark contrast between Disney\u2019s and Universal\u2019s line management. \n\nGenie+ at Disney is much more affordable ($20 to $35 per person per day), and thus, a lot of people actually buy it. Genie+ lines often get backed up and take 20-30 minutes at the popular rides, even though you have to make a reservation on the app for each ride you use Genie+ on. Meanwhile, the standby lines move at a crawl and frequently stop completely for 5-10 minutes just so they can let more Genie+ users through.\n\nExpress at Universal is more expensive ($80 to $300 per person per day) and it\u2019s not something that most guests buy. You almost never see Express waits over 15 minutes, and that\u2019s with them allowing Express users to just walk into the rides (no reservations needed). The standby lines also move at a much more steady and consistent pace, and almost never have to slow down since the Express lane is backed up.\n\nMaking fast passes more expensive can allow parks to still bring in extra revenue while providing a greater value for those that buy into the system and a better experience for everyone.\n\nEdited to add: **Ideally, I\u2019d prefer that paid \u201cskip the line\u201d services not exist at all,** and instead have either a free virtual queue system (like the old Disney FastPass) and/or just regular lines (as well as disability access services for those that need it). It\u2019s just that since parks found this as a profit opportunity, and they likely won\u2019t stop selling these, the next best thing is to make it expensive, rather than the affordable version like Disney\u2019s Genie+.",

        "text": "Something that irks my soul is how there are cheap housing communities for 55+ individuals in the range of 100-180k, but the cheapest starter homes for those of us 18-30 are in the realm of 280k+. I personally think its a waste of space because in many cases if someone were to pass away and leave the home to their children, they are typically forced to sell the house unless the HOA of the community isnt dead set on keeping all people under 55 out. Not to mention the plethora of homes that would become accessible on the market, could drastically cut home values which would lower overall costs. There's atleast 8 of these communities within 10 miles of my general area. \n\nEDIT: When i said 280k as lowest, thats a 600sqft shed on a small plot of land. 350k-400k will get you a new development home and all of the already existing homes can basically start at 450k and up. Average home price in my area is half a million.\n\nAlso, im speaking strictly on homes. Condos and apartments would be ideally the best solution for 55+ housing, while cheap double wides and manufactured homes would be ideal as starter homes for young families.",

You could turn your entire body in the opposite direction and they would step in front of you to continue the conversation. No type of obvious hints work. Even if you say your not in the mood they find a way to trap you in conversation.  Where as introverts already know what it is. They keep conversations short and simple.

Because kids actually color in fractions, they arrange shapes to make plants and animals. When the kids get to secondary school, geometry is just proofs and finding unknown lengths or angles. Of course, students will hate it.\n\nDon't get me wrong, axiom-based geometry is important. Euclid's *Elements* basically created the math we know today, but we can teach it differently:\n\n* Give teachers a sextant and have students determine the height of their house\n* Go to a local church and measure the radius of an arch\n* Carefully guide visually impaired students with cutting circles using a compass\n* Track the moon's position every week and mark it on an astrology chart. Yes, astrology is heretical, but you can't deny it's contribution to modern astronomy. This exercise gives students a good understanding of projecting planetary motion and ground tracks.\n* Model the leg motion of a popular dance\n\nAnd also, please emphasize compass-straightedge construction. I study engineering at an elite university. You'd be surprised how many A-students can't draw an octagon with a compass and straightedge; how many A-students who can't even list all 5 platonic solids.\n\nGeometry literally means measure the earth.

All this does is separate people more and more because your misunderstandings turn into full blown opposition due to your absolute refusal to discuss anything.\nThe best conversations I have had in my life were those when me and the other party fully disagreed, but were able to have a civil dialogue and come to understand where our disagreements come from. You might not convince the person to see things the way you do, but at least this removes the \u201cenemy\u201d aspect of it because you can start to understand why you have these differences.",

It is because his general's bad decisions put unnecessary risk to empire , like alerting the rebels the Empire is coming to Hoth (which required a ground assault, costing men's lives).\n* He also takes the time to go personally to the guy who is building the new Death Star to warn him \"our boss is pissed,  you'd better go back to schedule\". He is a bro trying to help his buddy before it is too late.\n* On the other hand he promotes individuals who are smart. Like the dude who read a strange signal from the probe droid which might have indicated the rebel base was in Hoth.\n\nIf you are smart and humble, you will do fine by having him to your side while crushing the rebel scum.",

Definitely my fault.\n\nSeriously, it takes nothing to not spoil a movie. You want to talk about a movie, and there is somebody in the room who hasn't seen it? Don't be a jerk, and just wait till the person has leaved the room or something. Costs you nothing.\n\nEdit: yes, we all know about the \"I am your father\" thing.

This isn't an excuse for spoiling the sixth sense though.\n\nEdit 2: I'm starting to think that these types of jokes of \"let us spoil x movie when talking about spoilers\", as many of you are doing, must be something exclusive to Americans or old people, as I have lived in various countries, and never met people doing it in real life.\n\nEdit 3: People here are really exaggerating the difficulties of not spoiling a movie. No, the whole world doesn't have to stop just so one random guy doesn't get spoiled. It is as simple as not having tittles on posts and videos that may spoil media, and not spoiling media on posts that aren't centered around that piece of media.\n\nOf course if you go to r/BreakingBad and get spoiled, that's you fault.\n\nfinal edit: im putting thin on the top of my post as i want to go through some recurrent misunderstandings and arguments of this thread\n\nfirs off, my post isnt about spoilers in general, my post is about how a movie being old changes nothing when talking about spoilers. newer generations are literally born with acces to internet. do we really expect them to have watched every single \"classic\" before the age of 18? You guys really think that is reasonable?\n\nalso, and again, it isnt as hard as you guy are making it to be. we dont have to cancel all conversations of all type of media. it is as simple as when you are on the internet, dont spoil things on the tittles of posts, use spoiler tags when spoiling a movie in a post that isnt centered around it, and thats it.

I've been with my wife for eleven years (met at 19) and we've been married for just under a year now. The amount we changed between 19 and 29 was obviously drastic, neither of us are the people we were when we met. We dated, spent time knowing each other, growing with each other, learning how we think and how we interact with each other.\nSo many people get married before they've even spent two holiday seasons with each other. It just feels so drastic to want to combine your life with someone else that quickly. Then five years down the line you don't like each other that much as time has passed, but now you have kids or a house or whatever and you feel stuck. Or you end it and are right back where you were seven years earlier with nothing but lawyer bills to show for it \n Marriage is about spending the rest of your life together, not just having kids cause you want them, or because you think marriage is the next step for you.\n\nIf you're planning to spend the rest of your life with someone, why not take the time before you've signed the contract?\nAnd for the people who get married in their mid 30s or so cause they want to have kids - you can always adopt. You don't need to permanently attach yourself to someone just to have a kid with your eyes or whatever. \n\nIDK just my thoughts.",

The texture of the meat is better and you can stuff the pita with all kinds of good stuff, any kind of shwarma or just the classic Lamb/Beef combo. Plus, the tzatziki or tahini sauce is so awesome. I find them consistently more delicious with my gyro than salsa is with my tacos. On top of that, the Pita, as food wrapping, is superior to the tortilla in so many ways. Its is more versatile, you can stuff a pita, you cannot stuff a tortilla. Its thick and hearty, fluffy even.  As good as corn tortillas are, they are prone to breaking, you can only make them so big and they are not fluffy in the slightest.  In fact, the only thing the corner taqueria has over the gyro man is horchata. \n\nGyros > Tacos",

People who spoke the languages intermingled with each other and mixed words and phrases, and combined with words\u2019 meaning naturally changing over time, eventually made a new language.\n\n If you truly think that original=correct, either start speaking Proto-Indo-European or admit that you only think the language you happened to grow up with is somehow objectively correct. \n\nTldr: The only true way to determine whether a word\u2019s usage is correct is whether it is understood and whether the intended tone is conveyed. Any other attempt to decide what\u2019s correct is usually just \u201cthis is how I grew up using the language so it\u2019s somehow objectively correct.\u201d ",

She thinks she's better than everyone else and that she doesn't need anyone's help.

She often comes across as condescending and dismissive, and she's quick to judge others without fully understanding their circumstances. In the third movie, Mockingjay, she is chosen as the symbol of the rebellion, but she struggles to actually be a leader and is always trying to run away from conflict like a coward.\n\n\r\r  \n Katniss Everdeen is a terrible protagonist who I couldn't bring myself to care about.

That\u2019s a mystery..\n\nBesides, the features iPhones offer are nothing different from what high-end smartphones were offering since like 13 years ago (when all this was getting started). \n\nWhat value have they added to their phones in these 13 years, if any at all?\n\nThis is not even minimalism.. given the complications of the smartphone altogether, it\u2019s just plain lack of features \n\nAnd btw I appreciate Apple a lot for their MacBooks, I have one & I love it, it\u2019s the reason I thought of switching to iPhone and I\u2019m somewhat disappointed.. in all fairness, I believe they need to up their smartphone game drastically (not necessarily with above features but in general)\n\nEDIT: I\u2019m surprised at the dedicated defence you all have presented, idk what it is if not blind brand loyalty. Not a single one of you have been able to present a reasonable argument for why would the manufacturers miss out on the basics. The only reasoning you\u2019ve slapped is \u201cwe don\u2019t even need it, we don\u2019t give a f*ck\u201d, in a bitter tone of course. A lot of you are just too comfortable with the status quo of iPhone experience and are convinced that that\u2019s all you need while simply dismissing the fact that these features and many others would make it easier and more comfortable to use at the end of the day. As far as the  \u201csimplicity of iPhone\u201d argument is concerned, why are you willing to pay such high prices for such a \u201csimple\u201d phone? Tell me how will you ever justify paying so much for a phone that offers anything but just the basics from 10 years ago? No justification needed from sellers, they\u2019re just marketing it brilliantly and you all are too proud to admit that it is actually overpriced phone with limited functionality and that they can & should do much better. But you\u2019re all just too afraid to challenge some invisible status quo. Nevertheless, thanks for engaging and I really appreciate the efforts of you all.",

Nobody told them why it's important in terms they understand, so they feel it's busy work and that's just not fun.

But the point is that people like success, and dislike failure. Math is one of those subjects where if you didn't do well one year, odds are you aren't going to be good at it next year since each subsequent year depends a lot on the developed skills of the previous year.\n\nIt's a slippery slope. One bad year will lead to a decade of frustration. And almost everyone has a difficult time at one point or another. The problem is other people /mostly teachers/ simply leave them where they are.",

(Even if they saved the extra $5 a week a ticket would cost) \nKnowing the odds and understanding that it will in 99.99999 percent of the time not pay for itself doesn\u2019t take into account the fact that the thought and hope of a chance at a completely different lifestyle can drastically improve someone\u2019s life.\n\n$5 dollars a week helps me get through 60 hours of work, gives me wonderful things to daydream about, helps me enjoy watching content about cars I will never be able to afford, and gives me 2 times a week during the draw something to get excited about. That\u2019s a better investment than 99% of things I would spend that $5 on otherwise.\n\nFor People that don\u2019t feel this way it\u2019s fine, but for those that do. It is a very worthwhile investment.\n\n\nEdit: A couple of notes.\nThis was apparently indeed an unpopular opinion.\n\n1. A lot of people seem to have a problem with the word \u201cinvestment\u201d as for them this is aways means a financial investment with positive expected financial returns. I understand this and should have possibly used another word. but as the very first sentence says I have no EXPECTATIONS of positive financial returns. \n\n2. Lottery also seems to have multiple different meanings. Where I am from the lottery is the euro jackpot, twice weekly drawn, \u20ac10 million- 120\u20ac million ball lottery. Each ticket cost 2\u20ac. I have never bought scratch it cards, or similar.\n\n3. I am talking about people in a financial secure position that can SPARE $5. I work hard, save well, invest a much larger portion of my income than $20 a month. But instead of a Big Mac, or brand name shoes, I buy $5 worth of tickets. If you can\u2019t afford $5 a week on \u201cluxury items\u201d then don\u2019t buy a ticket.\n\n4. Finally. Maybe I should not of used the word \u201chope\u201d either. I love my life as is and as I said I am financially in a decent place and well on my way to a comfortable life and even slightly earlier retirement. Even if I saved that $5 a week and invested it I would see a difference of about  $20,000 by the time I\u2019m 65. This isn\u2019t an insignificant amount of money, but for me personally it probably won\u2019t change the last 15ish years of my life that much. \n$50,000,000 would however change my life dramatically, and for longer than 15ish years ",

In this end, it\u2019s just a continuation of high school cliques when people should actually be much more integrated into the university itself.\n\nSecond, the idea of rushing/pledging is a dumb ritual to create the veneer of exclusivity and merit, when really it\u2019s just a form of unnecessary hazing. It also generates a culture of elitism that has no place in society and does a poor job preparing anyone for the real world after college.\n\nThird, the bad rep they tend to have on campus just confirms how little the university as a whole benefits from these.

Those same people might even decry the thought of taking on the responsibility of parenthood, and oftentimes use that effort they put into making money for someone else as a reason why not to have kids. \n\nLike I've heard about students putting in massive hours and again, sleepless nights for months on end. If you're a medical student it'll likely be years before you are stable. If you're in the trades you could get permanently injured or have no time for yourself. If you get a high degree you might not have a much money as others in your age group due to student loan debt. If you're in a field that involves caringfor others then a mistake could cost someone else dearly or you might not even be situated for the work and now that effort you put in is fundamentally wasted. You then work until either you die early or can save enough to retire all old and less invigorated than when you were younger.  \n\nAsk them about kids though and those exact same reasons become the very reasons why they won't have any, lack of time,  the commitment for years, the sleepless nights, the short on money, maybe you won't be happy, maybe you'll make a mistake... these are all somwhow unacceptable sacrifices for kids but when it comes to fattening your employer's wallet everyone wants to fall all over themselves biting for that carrot. This is totally fucking backwards and as a society we need to put less importance on how someone makes their money and more importance on how they spend their time living the life they are striving for.",

However, if your version of comedy is talking to people who are offstage and then asking them more and more questions which then you laugh at, and then the audience laughs at you are not a comedian, you are talking to somebody. \n\nI went to Gabriel Iglesias\u2019s show, as well as Tom Segura. Two professional comedians then I went to about three TikTokers comedy show and was very disappointed at most of their jokes. Lot of them were small jokes, which then let up to an interview with the audience and then asking questions. \n\n\u201cdoes anybody here do this? how many people do this?\u201d THAT IS NOT A JOKE. It can however, I will admit, lead to a joke. But if you are going in hoping that somebody has an odd job, that you can make quick simple, bounceable  jokes you are not a comedian. I understand the comedy is a subjective thing and not one person could have the best humor and maybe their thing is talking to somebody off stage but then you\u2019re not really a comedian I mean I\u2019m sorry, but that\u2019s just my opinion.\n\nEdit: Perhaps I should rephrase, my point is that if you are trying to be a comedian, and the jokes/laughter you get from the audience is the important part of your routine, that means that to an extent the person on the stage can be swapped out for someone else. Your routine should have some kind of monologue and punchline not working off of someone else\u2019s life experience unless you were there aswell",

        "text": "Many people nowadays will gift things that they got on sale, in bulk, or with their employee discount that have *nothing* to do with the person they go to\u2026other than that they\u2019re seen as \u201ccute\u201d or \u201cfun\u201d or \u201cuseful.\u201d \n\nEven worse: the \u201cIt made me think of you!\u201d gifts that take one aspect of your identity (like being vegan or having long hair or liking music) that are only tangentially related to your actual, specific interests.  \n\nThese types of \u201cgifts\u201d are actually burdens that are given at the convenience and whim of the gift-giver. Usually they reflect *their* likes and interests, not those of the recipient. They\u2019re also the result of some of compulsive shopping habits that reflect this \u201cshop till you drop\u201d mentality that\u2019s infected the minds of too many people living in capitalist societies. \n\nIt is better to give gifts that are hand crafted, well-made, and thrifted with purpose than it is to spend money on soulless mass-produced junk.\n\nTL;DR Don\u2019t give someone a gift unless you\u2019ve taken the time to make it thoughtful in some way. \n\nEDIT: A few things that commenters brought to mind:\n1) Gift-giving should be a choice, not a compulsion. I agree with many of the commenters here who have said that thoughtful cards are more than enough.\n2) Money is a great gift, always. It\u2019s one way of showing support for either what\u2019s needed or wanted without judgment or pretense.\n3) Don\u2019t know what to buy someone? Anxious about getting it wrong? Write a note, give a gift card or cash, or simply have the courage to ask them what they\u2019d like. \n4) So many people saying that I\u2019m ungrateful or lack compassion, or suggesting that I\u2019m hoity-toity\u2014if you read my post carefully you\u2019d have noticed I didn\u2019t say that gifts must/should be given. Demanding gifts is equally as burdensome and selfish as giving gifts that have no meaning or utility for the recipient. My point is that people\u2019s conception of \u201cgift-giving\u201d is so warped by capitalism at this point that the act of buying someone something, especially if it\u2019s expensive or in multiples, is valued over intentionality and quality. \n5) I always receive unwanted gifts graciously, as one should. There\u2019s no reason to be rude or harsh toward someone. However, there\u2019s this secret shame that comes with this: of not liking the gift, of feeling like a bad person for not wanting it, etc. This is inherently unfair and makes gift-giving about the gifter and not the recipient. \n6) Not to mention having to now regift, donate, or throw something away. And then being asked about the gift later and then having to lie to appease these folks\u2019 egos. ",

Finding fault in other people and then gossiping about it was fun for her. She would come up to you, ask you what you thought of some other coworker who may have a mildly annoying habit quality, and if you don't say anything negative she would then lightly mention the trait that was mildly annoying. If you just agree that yes, that one trait is annoying, she would go to more coworkers and say that it was YOU who couldn't stand the coworker with a mildly annoying habit. It escalated until she was saying everyone doesn't like this person or that person. She did crap like that throughout the office. She was always looking for something new to criticize and it was her entertainment. Oh, and she had a PhD in bioinformatics so it wasn't a case of someone being poorly educated.\n\nSome people absolutely enjoy criticizing others, which is why celebrity tabloids have not gone bankrupt after all these years.

The thing is, most people label automation itself as the bad guy. Automation in general is a good thing. As humanity evolves, we have eliminated outdated jobs. In the past, plow animals and tools replaced humans, and machinery replaced plow animals. As technology evolves, human lives should get simpler and easier.\n\nThe issue is that our societies rely on jobs. We are not prepared for low entry jobs to be eliminated, as thousands of people will not have the means to earn the needs of life. Instead of allowing lives to continue to get simpler, and working hours continue to shrink, we've expected people to continue working the same amount even though the workload is lessened. \n\nThis is also shown in the WFH movement. Once WFH was made more popular, there were people working 3+ jobs at the same time due to the workload really only needing a few hours from them. In today's society you need someone to pay for hours of your life, not just for a task to be completed. The more things that come out that reduce the amount of hours needed should be seen as a good thing, but without any safety nets in place, it does more harm than good for the working class.",

        "text": "I'm tired of seeing people making fun of others just because they \"peaked\" in high school. You can peak in high school and still not be a loser in the adult world. I'm sorry some of you out there had a shit time in high school, I know teenagers can be mean, but just because you had a shit time doesn't mean everyone else has to feel bad about having a great time in their teenage years. I peaked in high school and I'm not afraid to say it. I have a great and steady career in a job I enjoy, I'm saving for a house, I have investments and savings, I have friends and family that I am close to and see regularly, I have hobbies that keep me happy and fulfilled in off work hours. But do you know what was way more fun?  Being in high school.\n\nI have to pay rent as an adult, I have to pay bills, I have to go grocery shopping, I have to cook meals on my own. You know when I didn't have to do any of that shit? When I was in high school. I worked so I could have money to buy a beat up car, gas, some beer/weed money but that was much less hours than the 40 I work now and I didn't have to commute for an hour everyday to clock in at Wendy's. And you know what the worst that would happen if I hated my job and I told the manager at wendys to fuck off? I just go home and look if McDonalds has any openings. If I told my manager to fuck off these days I have to explain to potential new employers why I left my last job and hope they don't call my old company to ask and if I don't find a new job in time I lose my car, my apartment, my savings, and my dignity.\n\nYou know what else you can do in high school that you can't as an adult? Slack off on your \"day job\". In school you just have to be there and you can stare at the wall and give half assed answers if you don't feel like participating that day. Yeah you have to complete homework, and quizzes, and tests but I knew some real dumb motherfuckers who put in zero effort and the school bends over backwards to get them graduated and out the door. In the real world if I stare at the wall all day and give half assed responses to my bosses questions I get reprimanded and possibly fired.\n\nYeah having to live under your parents rules can suck but sneaking around those rules and slipping out to smoke a doobie with your friends is an exhilarating experience you cant replicate just sitting on the couch in your apartment. All of your friends are also nearby in the same city so you don't have to plan get togethers a week in advance because you all live spaced out from each other. Not to mention you probably cant even all get together with a weeks notice because you all now have jobs and family and responsibilities. In high school you can just text the group chat and all meet up within 30 minutes.\n\nYou also get organized sports in high school. I was a multi sport varsity athlete and it was fucking awesome. You get your name in the paper, people praise you just because you can throw a ball well, our biggest football games against the cross town rival had crowds of 20,000 people to watch you play a game and they all cheer you on when you do something good. These days if I bragged about the hat trick I scored in men's league the night before no one would care and at work if I nail my quarterly report I get a \"good job\" from the boss and then its on to the next task.\n\nI'm not debating there are parts of adulthood that are better but I had way more fun on a daily basis in high school than I do as an adult toiling away at a desk for 40 hours a week looking forward to the 3 days of vacation I can finally take in a few months when I save up enough PTO (if my boss approves it). So I'm sorry some of you had a bad experience in high school but that doesn't mean you have to be bitter and make fun of others who may have had the best time of their lives.\n\nEdit: ok I get it people I had a different definition of peak than you do you don\u2019t need to be the 174th person to point it out",

The problem is that this isn\u2019t like betting on red or black at a casino with a 50/50 chance of winning and that you can bet a small amount and not hurt your wallet much. How many people out here have dumped their life savings into starting their dream business or moved to some dream city to follow their passion and it fails. Now again these people always preach \u201cdon\u2019t be afraid to fail\u201d ok so when these things happen(very often) next thing you know you\u2019re filing for bankruptcy, wife is leaving you because you can\u2019t support her or yourself, you\u2019re asking your parents to move back in with them and you\u2019re out of all the money you saved up for 10, 15 or 20 years. \n\nThe job you\u2019re at most likely offers a 401k match, health insurance, pays enough to cover your bills and probably gives you some level of work life balance. So sure you won\u2019t know unless you try just like we all might not know how many times we avoided death by leaving the house 30 seconds later. But telling people to just leave that \u201cbullshit\u201d job that can provide you with a roof over your head, food in your mouth and coverage for when you or your children get sick or seriously ill doesn\u2019t sound like the living hell most of these influencers make it out to be. \n\nThe fairytale of moving to Hollywood with 50$ to your name and making it big is just that a fairytale where you might have a 1-1000000 shot of making that happen. Anyone who hasn\u2019t gotten incredibly lucky but worked on toward their dream overtime will tell you to work on your passion on the side and when your passion starts to pay your bills then you can quit but don\u2019t ever just leave and think that your dreams or passion will just come true and that you\u2019ll be so happy you took that risk, you very well may seriously regret taking that risk",

The work you have to do is between you and you -- controlling your anger, controlling your insecurity, not being petty, doing your share of chores, trying to be a grown-up. It doesn't mean you should be constantly hashing out why the other person has upset you, how you both need to change, why you've disappointed them, why they've disappointed you, what you mean to each other, where things are going, etc. Those conversations rarely help and turn into another way of people manipulating each other during bad relationships. \n\nIf the whole relationship feels like work, you're probably with the wrong person.",

Yes, it's definitely sweet of somebody to get into the office in the morning and announce that they brought bagels or doughnuts; but if I've already eaten breakfast, then either I don't get to partake (which has the added risk of offending whomever brought the food), or I over-consume calories that morning. Or maybe they surprise the office with pizza for lunch. Always a good choice, except if I brought my lunch that day and it won't keep another day, then either food gets wasted or, again, we over-eat. Speaking of over-eating - if somebody is on a fitness journey and only gets one cheat-meal this week, it would be unfortunate if they used that up prior to learning pizza was being provided.\n\nSurprise meals provided at work are certainly done with good intentions, but it can add annoyance or frustration to those who have made their own meal arrangements because they were not aware the food was coming.\n\n  \nEdit: a common theme in the comments is that I simply don't have to partake. The nature of my post stems from the fact that I actually have received soft reprimands for not partaking. Even if I stand with the group without eating the food (so that I'm still there, socially speaking), I still receive that reprimand.\n\nAnother common theme is that I am bringing negativity to the workplace. Let me assure you all that I am NOT expressing any of my opinions in the workplace. I am silent. I over-eat when the pressure compels me to do so, and I dodge eating when it appears I can get away with it. I have not insisted more than anybody else that I was not hungry, and there has been zero attitude. Yes, I'll try to say I'm not hungry, but then comes the soft reprimand that I should eat the food in solidarity with my coworkers, and that's when I get faced with a choice. In those situations, I usually elicit a cheap joke, which garners some chuckles, and then eat the food being offered. ",

Our sentiment and hard work has become a game for such companies now.\n\nMany interviewers and people in jobs, what I've personally seen people do all day is justify that they work, and adapt this overly sensitive and fake attitude amongst their peers. Their behaviour and language sometimes actually feels like Chat GPT under human flesh. \n\nI highly respect and love people who are realistic and honest with their personalities, and are clear and concise.

We have endless entertainment at our fingertips, and our phones are always nearby, pulling us away from simple tasks.\n\nMaking dinner from scratch can feel like a huge chore when you\u2019re bombarded with notifications or tempted to scroll through social media. Similarly, handling normal life admin becomes a struggle when you're distracted. \n\nSome argue that back in the day, when only one parent worked, life was easier. But I grew up in the '90s with both parents working, and while it was hard, I don\u2019t think it felt as overwhelming as it does now. They managed to juggle responsibilities without the constant pull of digital distractions.\n\nWe often blame our jobs for our fatigue, but the reality is that our environment is draining our focus and energy. It\u2019s not just about being busy; it\u2019s about being overwhelmed by distractions. We need to acknowledge how this affects our ability to do even the most basic things.\n",

The real problem isn\u2019t that good music doesn\u2019t exist or that artists today are worse than the 90s or before. The problem is that music companies don\u2019t have full control of the landscape anymore. We have more and more independent artists now and a person can\u2019t just turn on a radio and hearing the exact same music everyone else is listening to with nothing else to compare to. Now everyone has their own playlist catering to their own interests. I have a feeling that those who aren\u2019t listening to good music just don\u2019t want to take the time to find it in this new landscape. So many projects that I love get treated as if they must suck because they\u2019re not on the charts. Too many adults have chart addiction and need to start organically looking for artists and albums they like on a personal level. ",

It stems from a culture that places immense value on individual fulfillment through work. The notion that we should all find one passion overshadows the reality that most people have multiple interests and skills, not just one singular calling.

        "text": "A sentiment I commonly see when strangers behaving poorly in public is complained about is that you should be expected to confront them first to ask them to stop politely. I've even commonly seen people ridiculed for failing to do so and mocked for not speaking up or for reporting them to an authority (not necessarily police) without ever engaging them directly.\n\n\nI'm talking about situations where someone complains about someone doing something like playing loud music at night, not picking up after their dogs, casually blocking a high traffic path with a shopping cart, taking up too much public seating when little is available, etc.\n\nA specific example that comes to mind is how many people I've talked to seem think I was immature for reporting my apartment neighbor to my apartment management for playing loud bass heavy music after midnight that was shaking my walls. Apparently, I should have knocked and asked them to stop first. I don't disagree that this is a good step to take. I just don't think that it should be an expectation.\n\nI'm of the opinion that people shouldn't have to do this. We shouldn't be expected to confront people as a default. People shouldn't have to be asked to not be a nuisance in public. They should just not be a nuisance to begin with. My desire to not have to confront someone who engages in inconsiderate behavior is higher than my desire to rid myself of a minor nuisance. Having to instruct a stranger on proper public etiquette is often more annoying than than that etiquette being violated.\n\nPeople are not entitled to the opportunity to have strangers around them monitor their behavior to guide them to behave acceptably. They should conduct their manners appropriately on their own.\n\nI have literally never had to have someone ask me to stop being a nuisance. Because I am considerate and pay attention to how my behavior is affecting my surroundings. Why afford inconsiderate people the privilege of hand holding them on public etiquette?\n\nPay attention to how your behavior is affecting those around you. Its not other people's job to do that for you. You don't get points for being apologetic and stopping AFTER being confronted. Too many people just do whatever the hell they want expecting other people to let them know when they've crossed a line. They are always exude an obnoxious confidence and don't spend any mental energy preemptively being considerate.\n\nBeing considerate isn't passive. Its active. You have to think about it and pay attention. If you aren't ACTIVELY being considerate in public then you are being inconsiderate, and there is no way you aren't bothering people around you constantly while being blissfully unaware.",

Those loans then create interest which goes back partly to the universities and partly to governments, like a cunning tax scheme. Also, as a higher % of kids go to university, there are fewer of the very smart kids and the cohort becomes steadily more average. That means that the courses get steadily dumbed down until students learn less complex things than they would have say 20, 30, 40 years ago.

I do think that tends to be true and common enough, except that it\u2019s actually appropriate as we grow older but our concept of friendship has not matured with us. And it\u2019s a call for us to be intentional about developing and keeping friendships\n\nIn younger years, friendships are often due to proximity and availability. This means we get a lot of time to spend with people, from a schedule that other people plans, and bond over shared experiences (being in school, mainly), as opposed to shared values. It doesn\u2019t require a lot of intentionality or effort to keep friendships. And complacency is actually rewarded. (Avoidance of conflict, being \u201cjust there\u201d, etc.)\n\nWhen we grow into adulthood and have more responsibilities plus distance, we actually need to focus on making time for connections, and be more intentional about what we seek to give and receive from others. We also need to learn to make do when life circumstances, ours or others, require time apart. That also means we get to learn the importance of being well when we\u2019re alone.\n\nSo I do believe it is more difficult to make friends as adult, especially if we tend toward low effort with people, but learning to navigate it in a more difficult setting is supposed to be one of the things that help us become more well rounded over time.",

I feel that because of that alot of people have difficulty preparing a nice fulfilling meal.\n\nI think it's good to learn cooking at schools so kids/teenagers can learn how to make basic meals and perhaps also how to eat healthy.

You can go on just fine with the rest of your life, be happy and still feel like whatever this person did to you wasn't ok and that they're not worthy of your forgiveness. You'll definitely be able to find peace, because you're standing up for yourself. \n\nI was trying really hard to forgive someone I used to be friends with, who wrongfully accused me of something terrible (although they never really asked for forgiveness) because I thought forgiving was the *right* thing to do and in the past it has always come naturally to me -- but this time I realized, I didn't want to forgive them because I just wasn't ok with them betraying my trust and disrespecting me.

        "text": "The first Gen Viper was relatively more affordable and a more radical departure from daily driver performance than previous factory hot rods. \n\nLet me 'splain. \n\nWhat was the average person driving in 1995? A fwd econobox with ~150-220 horsepower, a 4-speed auto, 205 or 215 series 16\" tires, airbags, abs, collapsible steering wheel, shoulder belts, etc- slow, safe, and predictable. \n\nThe best selling car in 1995 was the Taurus- dead center on all those stats. \n\n1995 Viper? 400 horsepower, RWD, 6-speed manual, summer compound 275/40R17 front / 335/35R17 rear tires, no abs, no traction control, etc. \n\nThe Viper cost ~1.35 times the average MSRP of a new car in 1985.\n\nNow, let's look at the apex of factory hot rods at the apex of the 1960s horsepower war- the 1969 ZL-1 Corvette. \n\nWhile there was a much larger range of engine (and therefore horsepower) options in 1969, the average car in 1969 had lap belts and no other safety features, a 6 or 8 cylinder with 150-225 horsepower, 205-215 width 14 or 15\" tires, and a 3 speed auto or 3-4 speed manual. \n\n1969 ZL-1 'Vette? ~450 horsepower, lap belts and nothing else, 225 width 15\" tires, and a 4 speed manual. \n\nThe ZL-1 cost ~1.75 times the average MSRP of a new car in 1969. \n\nNow, sure, there's a lot of variability here, but the basics are obvious: while both the Viper and the ZL-1 (or GT500, or Hemi 'Cuda, or COPO Camaro) roughly double the horsepower of the average family car in their day, the Viper has far fewer safety measures, a far greater performance envelope, and is far more affordable to the average dentist than a late '60s supercar. \n\nIf you bolted the ZL-1's polyglas Goodyears onto a 1969 SS350 Camaro it wouldn't really change the look or performance. \n\nPut 275ZR17 summer tires on a '95 Taurus and see what happens. \n\nIn conclusion: if you stepped from a 383 RoadRunner (300 or so hp) into a ZL-1 (~475 hp) in 1969 you spent more money and generated more tire smoke, but your performance and handling weren't radically different and you already expected your daily driver to try to kill you.\n\nIf you stepped from a 1995 Supra (with 300 hp) into a Viper you got a car that was radically more capable with far fewer electronic nannies. \n\nBecause the Viper was (comparably) much more affordable to the average buyer in 1995, more realistically you were stepping from a ~250 hp Camaro, Porsche, or BMW with ABS and traction control into a 400 hp Viper with none of those things. \n\nSo, like I said, the Viper was purchased and driven by people with the wrong expectations in a way late 60's monsters weren't.

The CFL, while cherished by some, faces declining viewership, financial instability, archaic rules dating back to the 1800s and a limited talent pool compared to the NFL. By introducing NFL teams into Canada, fans would gain access to the highest caliber of competition, uniting North America under a single football standard.\n\nThis shift would also stimulate the growth of high school and college football in Canada, which has largely stagnated. With the NFL's presence, more resources, visibility, and opportunities would be available to young Canadian athletes. This would lead to increased participation and development at the grassroots level, creating a stronger pipeline for future talent.\n\nFurthermore, an NFL expansion into Canada would spark thrilling new rivalries, like Vancouver versus Seattle or Toronto against Buffalo, energizing fan bases and regional pride. For fans, an NFL presence would offer a more consistent and familiar product, drawing larger crowds and sponsorships. Tradition is important, but the future of football in Canada lies in unifying with the NFL to ensure long-term growth, competitiveness, and international appeal.",

A lot of people seem to treat this as if it's a normal thing - but before smartphones, I had never seen any camera save photos mirrored.  You'd have to manually flip it if you wanted it to appear that way.\n\nSmartphone camera software these days often save selfie photos flipped horizontally, like you're looking in a mirror.  I've never understood why they do this, or why any of the phone developers thought this would be a good idea.  People share selfies on social media fairly often, and often, it's obvious that they're mirrored, because text is backwards, etc..  IMO it looks a bit weird.  I've even seen at least one where the person posting said something like \"check out my shirt\", and the text was mirrored..  They could have made it a bit easier to read by sharing a non-mirrored photo.  Even if there isn't any text or obvious signs, I think a photo being shared should basically represent reality.  I wouldn't want to share photos that would make someone appear right-handed when they're actually left-handed, or if I'm sitting in my car, I wouldn't want to make it look like my car is right-hand drive when it's actually left-hand drive, etc..\n\nSmartphone camera software often has an option to disable saving this way (and I do have mine disabled), but I don't know why this was ever a thing in the first place.  And with my current phone (Google Pixel 8), if I text a selfie to someone, it seems it saves the selfie mirrored, regardless of the fact that I have that option disabled.

Where do we draw the line on what is too dangerous?  \n\nSince the dawn of civilization we have had one on one contests for glory and profit as well as entertainment. We have set aside for the most part contests to the death or cripling injury such as unprotected fighting with edged weapons, and we have been hovering at the level set by boxing and now MMA. Violent, sometimes ugly... but even then there are rules to mitigate injury. Modern fighting with blunt instruments or swords involves armor and strict rules. And the more extreme forms of bare knuckle and unregulated underground fighting are often rejected like we reject dog fighting and cock fighting.\n\nBut amidst the modern conversation of CTE and brain injury affecting popular sports, we now see Slap Fighting. No chance to avoid injury. There can be no debate... it is literally mashing the brains of people against the insides of their skull. EVERY hit is the same as the worst hit a fighter takes in a match, possibly a career. It is the concentration of the worst parts of boxing, and that is ALL it is. There is no art or chance to avoid anything. \n\nIn summation... I already have a tough time with many combat sports but at least they have a CHANCE at avoiding the worst of it - they are an actual test of one's self and opponent. It makes me sick that Slap Fighting is compared to the more brutal sports, much less the noble combat sports like BJJ and Arm Wrestling. I believe only bad things can come of it, and anyone who supports Slap Fighting is making a moral and ethical mistake. It is not a martial art, it is not a risk or test, it is only pure self destruction and currently one of the lowest forms of entertainment.",

It\u2019s almost like they want to erase their history because it\u2019s filled with mistakes, bad decisions, or behaviors they\u2019re ashamed of.\n\n  \nBut here\u2019s the thing \u2014 the past does matter in relationships. It shapes who we are, the choices we\u2019ve made, and how we treat others. Ignoring someone\u2019s history, especially if there\u2019s been dishonesty, cheating, or toxic patterns, can be dangerous. If someone is quick to say their past is off-limits, I can\u2019t help but see that as a red flag. To me, real growth and healthy relationships come from being open and honest about our mistakes, not pretending they never happened.\n\n  \nWhat do you think? Does a person\u2019s past matter in a relationship, or should it be left behind?",

Being on a large fandom just sucks, it feels like every second someone in the fandom is exposed as problematic, there are arguments every second, it's like every large fandom is just full of toxic people that are only there to make the fandom's reputation drop. Being in a dead/small fandom, however, is pretty chill, since there are barely any people in it there are not that many weird or problematic people, it's all pretty calm, there are still some arguments and \"stuff\" but it's mostly just pretty chill in general.\n\nI don't get why people go like \"uhhhh my fandom is so small waaaa thats so sad it needs to be more recognized\" and that's something i don't agree with. Have you seen what the internet did to Digital Circus, Fundamental Paper Education, the Backrooms and other things that were once popular? Yeah, you should be thankful that your fandom isn't that big and enjoy while it is still small, for example, Making Fiends isn't that big of a fandom (right now) and i think it's better that way.\n\nHonestly, i'm just trying to enjoy the time i have where the small fandoms i'm in are small and not that known, it's only a matter of time before the internet absolutely shreds it. I hate living in this reality where we can't have ONE thing untouched by the internet, i really need to permashift.\n\nTL;DR The internet ruins fandoms (or just anything in general) so it's better when your fandom is small and not that known.",

        "text": "People are quick to claim we've moved past the brutal practices of history, like burning women for witchcraft or the horrors of slavery. Yet today, emotions and groupthink still cloud our judgment-when a collective shares a sentiment, many are quick to adopt it without questioning its validity. This makes it easy to fall into the same mindsets that existed in the past. For instance, during the early 20th century, there was mass hysteria and fear during the Red Scare, where innocent people were accused of being communists, often with little evidence. While these examples may seem less extreme than the barbaric practices of the past, the amount of blinded emotion today suggests that, left unchecked, people could just as easily commit atrocious acts.\nThis is evident even in extreme, unwarranted 'hate trains' over trivial issues. We see people piling on hate for something as minor as being annoying or mildly problematic-where many join in on the outrage without genuinely caring about what the person did. A good example is cancel culture, where someone's mistake-whether it's a poorly worded tweet or a past behaviour (excluding bigotry)-is met with excessive outrage and attacks, even if most people don't care that much about the issue. People are quick to jump on the bandwagon without thinking critically. This shows that our collective behavior mirrors past barbaric practices, proving human nature hasn't evolved as much as we'd like to think. while we\u2019ve evolved away from these particular acts, the mechanisms that allowed them to happen\u2014emotional manipulation, fear-based decision-making, and groupthink\u2014are still very much present.\n\n",

Also he\u2019s unfunny.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nMy understanding of the whole affair is as follows:\n\n1. Jay Leno didn\u2019t want to retire. He was pushed out by the studio.\n2. Upon being pushed out, he indicated that he would seek employment elsewhere.\n3. Not wanting him working for a competing network, the studio instead gave him a show with an earlier slot.\n4. The earlier slot split the audience \u2013 Conan\u2019s show suffered as a result.\n5. The studio reneged on Conan, and cut him a fat cheque for his troubles. Leno resumed as host of the Tonight Show.\n\nI\u2019m gob smacked that anyone can see this order of events and think that Leno did anything wrong here. Can you imagine, in your personal life, having your dream job and your bosses being like \u201cWe want you to retire so that we can bring in a younger guy who we like more. That\u2019s cool right? Also please sign this non-compete agreement and go away.\u201d\n\nNo effing way. Of course you\u2019d fight tooth and nail to hang on.

He\u2019s not responsible for him or his career. Further, I think Conan was (and continued to be) doing just fine without the gig, so the overflow of sympathy for someone that wealthy and privileged was/is unwarranted.\n\nWhenever these events comes up, there\u2019s also a piece about how Leno was never particularly funny. I think that this is subjective and irrelevant. He had a stellar run as host of the show, regardless of anyone\u2019s opinion about his comedic value. Clearly some people found him enjoyable to watch. I think that\u2019s an objective truth.\n\nLastly, Leno just generally seems like a good dude. Eff the haters.

        "text": "I often see this sentiment where if you actively do something (or have done something) and talk against it, you're just a hypocrite. That's not even logical and it's complete bullshit to anyone that actually thinks about it. \n\nExample; someone that smokes tobacco telling people that smoking tobacco is negative and stupid. You'll always get offended people complaining about \"well YOU do it!!\" but it's like no shit, that's literally why I'm talking about it and that's literally why I have the qualifications and justification to talk about it. It isn't even logical to call someone a hypocrite. Every addicted smoker on earth should know it's stupid and they just push people away from the addiction. Any logical smoker that's mature enough to admit their problems would do just that. If you have literal experience and knowledge of something, it makes logical sense to share that knowledge. Who is someone going to listen to more; someone that's actually been through it and living through it, or someone that just read a few online articles? Come on now. \n\nBut the thing is, people are so half assed on what they call hypocrite. They usually only call someone a hypocrite when it's about something they personally feel some kind of way about, regardless if what they're saying is the truth. Like to bring me back to the original example; just because I/someone smokes tobacco, that literally doesn't change anything that's being stated or the truth behind it. Being offended that someone that's there/been there is talking negatively about it is just ignorant. With experience comes wisdom, with wisdom comes life lessons. That's just the way it goes. \n\nAlmost everyone laughs, claps and cheers for inmates in prison that do the \"beyond scared straight\" programs; showing the youth their mistakes and where it could bring them. Talking against the things they used to do doesn't make them a hypocrite, it makes them someone that's sharing firsthand, secondhand and third hand knowledge. Just because someone doesn't like what's being stated doesn't magically make them a hypocrite. It means they're teaching and influencing people to not make those same decisions. \n\nThere's a line though. Is it \"wrong\" for someone to make another out to be the most fucked up person in existence when they currently do the same things as them? In a way, yeah, that would be hypocrisy, but either way that doesn't magically change or remove the fact that their actions could use adjusting. People all too often get sensitive about what someone says, call them a hypocrite and then just completely shut out anything logical that's being stated. Ignoring logic because you don't like who's saying it (or how it's being said) is just immature ignorance. You don't need to like who's saying it, you don't need to like how it's being said, but actively ignoring the truth behind the statements is arrogance. And if it's coming from someone that's literally living that life? Just quit getting offended and be open/mature enough to hear them out. \n\nMoral of the post; quit calling everyone that has experience with something a hypocrite when they talk against it. That's what happens when people want to teach and push others to do better than them. Are you not gonna listen to a drug addict telling you not to get into the drugs they're doing because it'll ruin your life, just because you arrogantly don't want to listen? \n\nNothing everything is being a hypocrite lol. \n\nHope everyone is doing good. Hope everyone in your lives is healthy and alive. Enjoy the rest of your Monday. ",

Sure, it\u2019s not everything, but the aesthetics you vibe with can help you express yourself, find your values, and even guide your personal growth.\n\nWhy do people assume that caring about how something looks makes it superficial? When you explore different aesthetics\u2014whether it\u2019s the way you dress, how you design your space, or what kind of art and music you\u2019re into\u2014it\u2019s not just about looking good for others. It\u2019s about finding what feels right for you and what makes you feel like the most authentic version of yourself.\n\nIf someone\u2019s into minimalism, maybe it\u2019s because they want more peace and simplicity in their life. If someone\u2019s embracing bright colors and chaotic styles, maybe it reflects their bold personality. It\u2019s not just \u201csuperficial,\u201d it\u2019s a reflection of who they are and what they value.\n\nI think people are quick to dismiss aesthetics because they associate them with vanity or consumerism, but when used thoughtfully, they can be powerful tools for self-expression and even personal growth.\n\nSo, exploring aesthetics isn\u2019t shallow\u2014it\u2019s a real way to discover and express your authentic self. \nWhat do you think?",

Of course people should do their own research. But, that fact is not an excuse for one to not back up their claim. In fact, someone could do their own research AND ask for the source for the claim that someone is making. Furthermore, wouldn't you want to see the piece(s) of evidence that convinced who your talking with? You may be convinced right away but either way you could evaluate the legitimacy of the source.\n\n\n2. \"People that ask for a source are disingenuous\". If that's the case, then that is their issue. You can still supply the source that convinced you of your claim and that would be up to the other person to actually look at it or change their mind. If they're looking for some sort of \"Gotcha\" moment because you're unable to back up your claim, then you can turn that around on them by providing evidence.\n\n\nBottom line, there's no good reason to withhold the evidence you have for a claim.

I think the pods do a slightly better job than the liquid, but every time I wash in Tide, underarm BO is still in the armpit, and a majority of the stains I accumulate are there also. I am an incredibly sloppy eater so I compare the stain-fighting strengths of detergent pretty frequently. For a more controlled experiment, I threw my washable mop pad in with Tide after a weekend\u2019s worth of floor grime. Not much of the dirt was removed. It\u2019s a shame, because I love the smell of Tide. \n\nI recently got Gain, and repeated the same experiment with the mop pad. Almost all the dirt was removed. All Free and Clear does the best job, but Gain wasn\u2019t far behind. It also removes the BO. I really don\u2019t get the hype over Tide cleaning well. ",

        "text": "I'll explain what I'm talking about first. We all know the term \"basic\" where one's taste is very popular and, in turn, boring. Here are some examples. Someone's favourite song by an artist is their most famous song. Someone's favourite food is the original flavour. Someone watches mainstream reality TV. And if you relate to this, you might have been called \"basic\" by someone else.\n\nIt's simple why I think this term is an odd insult. Things are popular for a reason. If you like something that a crowd of people likes, it should be a good thing, right? That you have opinions that a lot of people agree with. \n\nThe same goes the other way. Unique styles don't make you better than anyone else. If you like chains and fishnet gloves, go for it. Self-expression is a generally positive thing. But if you think you're better than the people who wear Lululemon and have Stanley cups, you're wrong. Art is subjective, and you shouldn't be putting down someone else's self-expression. \n\nHere's another example, with music. Your favourite singer can be Taylor Swift, and it can also be Nirvana or something. If your favourite composer is Beethoven, don't force yourself to like Schoenberg just to be different. Your favourite Sabrina Carpenter song could absolutely be Espresso, instead of finding a niche song made 6 years ago just to be unique.\n\nWe were always told to be ourselves, so why should we forget that? If you agree, or even disagree, tell me why. Thank you for reading this long tangent.",

        "text": "A TV-show, a movie, a book or any other piece of media that takes heavy inspiration from another story or is in many aspects kind of a \"rip-off\" of this story is not necessarily bad. To me it is the execution of the story which matters. Is it entertaining, is it well made with interesting characters, good cinematography and an exciting and interesting story? If yes, I don't care that if it is the 100th iteration of the same old trope.\n\nLet's be honest, is there any story that is really 100% original. Everything which can be said or told has already been said or told. We can vary these old stories, give them new interesting twists and it will be a masterpiece.\n\nA new \"original\" story with truly new ideas is not automatically good. If the story is boring, bland and poorly made it will not be saved by its originality. Often it is quite the opposite where the novelty is the only aspect that makes a story notable, but the lack in execution kills it.\n\nI would rather have the 10 millionth adaptation of Snow White if it is well made and interesting than this new flashy epic tale that falls flat on its nose.\n\nAn example is the anime series \"Darling in the Franxx\" which gets lots of hate for various reason, one of them being that it is said to be a rip-off of \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\". I personally loved the show despite thinking that some of the criticisms have some reason, but that DitF is an Evangelion rip-off is none of them. Yes, it has many elements that are heavily inspired from the other show, but it does not take away from its qualities. It is its own story with interesting characters and great developments. That many scenes are basically copies from Evangelion scenes does not spoil the fun for me.",

        "text": "A lot of people seem to dismiss and discredit things they don't immediately understand. There was a post here saying that David Lynch films were completely incomprehensible and therefore have no value, and don't know what they're talking about. While I understand that stories and art told in a non-literal way can be confusing, I think that there's often times a lot more beneath the surface. \n\nSurrealism as an art form started to become prevalent shortly after Sigmund Freud released his book The Interpretation of Dreams\n\nSurrealism is considered a dreamlike art form, and some of the most well known surrealists were also interested in exploring their connection to their dreams, and interpreting what their dreams meant on a deeper level.\n\nSalvador Dali especially loved the theoretical ideas of Freuds book, and considers it to be one the most life changing discoveries.\n\nThis connection between the two, psychology, and dreams, seems to set the ground for surrealism.\n\nIf you look at art, wether that be film, painting, literature, or music. Whatever form that uses surrealism, it's often not because the artists are just \"throwing spaghetti at the wall, to see what sticks.\" Through the lens of their dreams they are trying to express something about themselves that they may not even be conscious of. \n\nZdzslaw beksinki, a polish surrealist started painting because he wanted to \"paint his nightmares\" when he started expressing his dream through the surrealist lens, it often became a dystopian nightmarish hellscape, the images are very dark and cerebral. A lot of his work is of gaunt, withered, distorted figures that appear in some state of dispare, or large authoritarian figures that appear as domineering and aggressive. \n\nThis starts to make sense when you consider that beksinki was raised as a boy in a post world War one poland, and lived his years into adulthood through the second world War. The images he made were likely him trying to express the frustration the helplessness, the hunger, the evil that he saw going on around him every single day.\n\nI could go on for hours with more examples, Francis Bacon, Franz Kuafka, Kurt Vonnegut, Charlie Kuafman, David Lynch, so on... \n\nBut the point would be the same, all of them try to express something about themselves, or the world around them in a way that may not seem like it makes sense, but is often a very introspective and thought out and human exploration. Even if it's not a literal interpretation of the things happening in the image.\n\nImagine an image of a pomegranate sitting on white cloth. The background is pitch black, except the dough eyes of a sad woman peering out from the darkness, just barely visble, her tears fall behind the pomegranate. It's been stabed with a sharp blade. A large hand of a male has been cut off, and now grips the blades handle. The pomegranate leaks deep red juice, which leaves the white cloth stained, and soaked.\n\nWhat is this image? Is it just a pomegranate which has now been cut? Or is this the expression of a woman who cannot have children? The pomegranate representing her fertility, or rather her lack thereof. The hand representing not only the hand of a potential ex lover who has left her with this infertile state, but also one who has been detached, but still lingers with the blade inside of her. Taking forever from her, the one thing that was hers. \n\nSymbolism is important, it can convey so much that isn't spoken. \n\nEverything isn't literal. The more we try to make it literal, the less meaning it has. ",

Then in 2020 it crossed into $510,400. \n\nAt the end of this year and currently for many lenders, the limit just shifted up to $802,650 which is a 65% increase in just 5 years. \n\nNow whats interesting here is that from 2006-2016, the loan limit remained at 417,000. The average price of a home from 2006-2016 went from 247,700 to 311,00 over a decade for a 25% increase. \n\nAt the start of 2019 the average home was 313,000 and today sits around 412,000 which is a 32% increase in half the time. \n\nThere is a notable upswing from 2020 to just 2022 where a home was 329,000 to 437,700 and thats a 33% increase in just 2 years. \n\nLong of the short, housing is rising abnormally fast and the govt whom sets these limits has done nothing but encourage higher prices. \n\nIf loan limits were still back at the 500k level, we simply wouldn\u2019t see the pace of value increase so incredibly. You may want to sell your home for some egregious number, but good luck finding a buyer. Its this rolling of limits up that is the root problem of housing being so expensive. \n\nLenders specifically don\u2019t lend their own money, but the govt\u2019s money. If the loan forecloses, your bank takes no hit at all, but the govt pays them out. Mortgage insurance/PMI exists specifically to help the govt recoup forclosed property and payouts to lenders. \n\nEveryone talks about all these solutions to the craziness that is the housing market, but its as simple as the govt not blindly raising limits. One may say that this would price regular people out of loans, but this is false as the lenders wouldn\u2019t bother lending their own money anyways. Home would *have* to stay cheaper to accommodate demand. Thus the fix is much simpler than everyone makes it out to be. Stop raising these dam limits and all of a sudden people will be able to afford homes again. ",

Can we *please* stop pretending that a game where you simply walk through empty spaces is a horror experience? Can we *please* drop the faux-philosophical undertones like this is some really intellectual, deep thing?\n\nAll I see is a 3d render of a space made by someone who cba or isn't capable of filling said space with detail like people, creatures, plants, etc. All I see is a game where the devs just made some levels and stopped developing right there an then while saying \"ooooh scary!\".\n\nYou know what we used to call a 3d model/render of an empty hallway?

I wrote whiskey off as just not being great for mixed drinks.\n\nUntil last Saturday. A friend at the bar recommended I try Jack and Sprite (and it was my first drink of the night, so no drunk judgements lol) and I was blown away at just how well the whiskey seemed to mesh together with the crisp flavor of the Sprite. I kept sipping the drink, expecting it to get nasty at some point, but it never did.\n\nEarlier tonight, I decided to try the mix at home, to rule out the possibility of the bar pouring light shots into my drink.

Everyone who experiences this kind of media experiences it in at least a slightly different way from anyone else. You know you've made something like this when many people agree that it's good, but everyone has a different opinion on why it's good. Let's call this layer \"Savory\".\n\n\nThen, you have media that's just fun. What you see is what you get, and it's a good time where you don't have to think too much. There's not a lot of substance, but the execution of the style makes it a pleasant experience. You know you've made this when everyone knows exactly why it's good just from watching it.  Let's call this layer \"Sweet\".\n\n\nAfter that, you have media that's dumb and bad. It's not trying to be smart and isn't claiming to, but also isn't giving the audience what it craves in terms of style. This is most often seen in adaptations of previously known media that doesn't deliver on what made the original good. These are your run-of-the-mill cash grabs that make no attempt to even seem like they care. You know you've made this when people just forget it and move on, or complain that it just didn't give them what they wanted. Let's call this layer \"Bland\".\n\n\nFinally, at the bottom of the barrel, you have media that wants to seem meaningful and like it's saying something, but the commentary it delivers is superficial, on-the-nose, or just flat-out nonsensical. The kind that doesn't speak for itself but the creator insists it does while begging to be asked for an explanation so that it doesn't have to. This is the media that insults its audience the most, and is the most unpleasant to experience, because it actively harms the audience's ability to think about what they're experiencing by forcing them to think but giving them nothing of substance to actually think about. No amount of style will save this kind of media from how blatantly it lies about having substance. You know you've made this when you've pissed off the audience to the point where they question your integrity as an artist. Let's call this layer \"Bitter\". \n\n\nWhat pieces of media come to mind when you hear about each of these layers and what they mean?",

On the flipside, an entrepreneur might have an idea that's only half-baked, and think ok, 'I must just need to grind it out' and end up burning themselves out as a result.",

        "text": "I somewhat find it annoying when people say a movie is bad because it is basically like this one movie, and people only remotely like it since they have not seen older movies. Same with other medium like books and to a lesser extend with games, and it just honestly a dumb argument. Don't get me wrong I do get the appeal of something being new and innovative, and the fact that seeing something similar can often lessen an experience. But there a reason why genre exist, because not all people mind seeing similar thing over and over again, it just about the execution and how a person put their own version.\n\nA big example is the Joker movie just being Taxi Driver and King of Comedy mix together, which those people are not wrong. But like what wrong with that, those are two good movies, and seeing someone imitate them and put their own version of it and having talented people working on it. Is not like its erasing Scorsese movie, and more people are hearing about them. Not to mention people act like its so easy to imitate something and come out successful, I mean just look at all the MCU copy cat and how they fall. \n\nI am not saying something being generic or similar to something can't be a reason for criticism, but that alone does not justify something being terrible in my opinion and just come off as lazy criticism sometimes.",

Some people may have two people that they are close with and they may be forced to work with others who they are not as confortable while people in big social groups can simply work together. A more fair system should be randomly assigning groups. Yes, the inconvinience of working with people who are hard to work with, might still be there, but everyone can have that problem. When your boss tells you to work with Miranda on whatever job you have you simply cannot say that you hate Miranda. In a way, for a future job the skill of working in a group can be better developed if you work with different kinds of people.",

        "text": "Now let me make one thing clear: there's nothing wrong with having school spirit. If you're able to take pride in your school, I'm happy for you. But I've just really never understood the point.\n\nI understand that every school is different, but in my high school it always seemed like school spirit was just a tactic by the administration to distract us from our school's problems. Sure, our school can't go a year without someone killing themselves, but let's focus on the big homecoming game against Smallville instead! I understand why the school wants to create  a strong sense of community, but if you want students to take pride in the school, then actually try to fix the issues instead of sweeping them under the carpet.\n\nEven without taking that into consideration though, it just seems pointless. I don't go to school to go to football games or dances, I go to school to learn. That's it. The whole point of school is that you leave at some point. So why form an emotional connection to a place that you're only going to be in for four years? \n\nCollege is a little different. I understand why people have more connections to college: a) they actually choose to go there, b) they most likely lived on the campus at some point, so it was basically a second home, and c) the friendships you make in college are a lot more stronger than the ones you make in high-school. But it still seems kind of pointless. You go to college to learn skills that will get you your ideal career. If you're just watching football and going to parties, you're in college for all the wrong reasons. \n\nTL;DR - A school is a vehicle for education. That's it. The purpose of school is to meet all the requirements, then move on. There is literally no reason for you to have an emotional attachment to your school. The only people I've met that have school spirit are the people that wish they could say in high school/college forever. And if you feel that way, you've done something very wrong.",

I don't know if the plot twist makes it more palpable to the viewers so it's always a happy ending, but to me a happy ending isn't necessarily satisfying about it. Like I'd prefer if it did something I didn't expect and be shocked and pissed off for abit, but still rave about the movie. \n\n\nMy favorite example of this is \"frozen\"(childish I know) but I would've liked it more if khristoff and Anna stayed friends for a little while and Anna developed her relationship with Hans and in the second movie she figures out Hans and her aren't really compatible and she gets closer to Kristoff or something like that. I don't know I just feel movies and TV are so predictable.  I want to watch something and be like \"I can already see where it's heading\" amd it turns out to be the exact opposite.

        "text": "Basically if you don't know, a tech YouTuber launched a wallpaper app that has an option to subscribe to it for $50 a year. This gives you access to every high resolution wallpaper on the app. It is important to note, that you do not need any subscription to access the app. The app right now has been fixed so that you have access to every 1080p wallpaper for free, and if you want the high resolution version of a particular wallpaper. You can watch an ad. Before this update, there were ads in the app that were unavoidable if you you didn't pay. Now this really is down to personal preference, but what \"free\" app do you know of that doesn't have ads? I may be glossing over a couple of other things that people did not like about the app, but the main gripe that many people had was that \"it cost $50\"\n\n I think that this gripe is overblown and even childish. It's a wallpaper app. It's not like Marques (the YouTuber in question) put all of his content behind  a paywall. It's not like he promised a free app and then pull the rug under everyone and announce that it was a paid app at the last minute. This was a random passion project, that was meant to give people high quality wallpapers AND MORE IMPORTANTLY support artists. Half of the proceeds that the app makes goes towards the artists, and that has always been the case for the app, not something that they added in an update.\n\nI just don't see how not downloading this app isn't the easiest way to avoid it. You think the prices are too expensive? Don't download it. Do you think the app was janky and had too many ads? Cool, don't download it. Personally, I wouldn't spend $200 on a Gucci belt, but that doesn't mean I want Gucci to take every belt that they have off their shelves, rework them, and then sell them again so that it meets standards to my liking. Instead, I am comfortable living in a world that has things that are not for me. \n\n",

Secondly, it frees up people to recline without hindering the person behind them.\n\nThe only real negative I can see, and I'm happy to be proven wrong, is that it does seem like it would be more claustrophobic for the people on the bottom row. The whole, \"You'll get pink eye every flight\" thing doesn't hold any merit in my eyes. Every picture I've seen of the double deckers has a seat and a solid barrier between the person on top and the person behind them, so it doesn't appear the risk of pink eye would be any higher on this type of plane compared to a regular plane.\n\n",

        "text": "Often I read and hear people say that it is the worst movie ever made. I imagine such judgments are made because it is being compared to The Exorcist, however I feel that, compared to the first movie, I actually prefer the second one.\n\nThe first movie suffers from the same drawbacks as many early 70s movies. The first hour or so is incredibly dull and lifeless. Many of the scenes are unnecessary and the structure is incoherent. \n\nMeanwhile the second movie actually creates a \u201cmythology\u201d surrounding the demon in the first film, gives it an origin in Pazuzu and the African mythology, something that it rarely covered in mainstream Hollywood film. The often ridiculed hypnotism scenes are nowhere near ludicrous as some other scenes seen in other horror movies of the time and even now. If the machine is considered OTT, then really the act of hypnotism in movies as a whole should be considered OTT. It\u2019s just a method they use for the movie to make it more visual.\n\nFinally I think the acting is not that bad. Richard Burton, a personal favourite of mine, is admittedly not at his strongest, which is no doubt due to his drinking, yet he still has presence to carry the film. I think Linda Blair is just as good here as in the first one and Louise Fletcher is good too, as it James Earle Jones (who actually trumps Burton in their scene together).\n\nIs the Exorcist 2 the best movie ever made? Of course it isn\u2019t. Is it the worst? Definitely not. ",

The play-by-play guy actually was only half-bad on this call (he only kinda screamed like a banshee) but the color commentator just yells \"YEAH!\" a bunch of times and you could hear him either falling or knocking shit off his desk. All in all, radio announcers are routinely awful listens and   ruin your experience listening to the game when you have to listen to it on the radio/radio stream. \n\nWhat's worse is that they are extremely good at the actual craft of broadcasting. They often do a remarkable job of painting a picture of what is happening on the field/ice - so you can see the ability is there - but they can't resist acting like blithering fools during a broadcast: yelling, ignoring whenever the opponent does anything well, not admitting they were wrong when replays or rules say they are, saying \"we/us/our\" etc. \n\nOne caveat: this does not apply to New York City or Los Angeles sports teams. Those guys are super professional and while they obviously get MORE excited when the home team succeeds they aren't completely disinterested or dispassionate when the opponent does something well. The further you get away from NYC/LA, the worse it gets. The Tampa Bay Lightning have the worst I have ever heard. I'm surprised they even say the other team's name.\n\nAlso, for extra bonus for those in Seattle: [Bret Musberger's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUK6opejgA8) call of Martinez' double is so much better than [Niehaus'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8SBJzOEcyU)",

In this sense the ethics of a relationship should also include how would be the method in case things go south, because sometimes behaviors in the ending process can throw away all the sense of worth of time and live given. \n\nObviously it can't be applied to all cases, but in general I guess this aspect of human (des)connection is blindsided such death in live as a subject of discussion.\n\nJust look at No Contact as a standard method of what happens after ending and people staying hooked in a lot of illusions with no touch of reality. A lot of unecessary pain. \n\nCommunication, closure, to be avaliable to give answers and to promote respect after a love story should be a quintessential to more healthy relationships and to avoid the majority of people to carry unecessary bagages to the next connection. And this behavior check should be mandatory as a trait check before como together with someone.\n\nAnd I believe that should be more a thing. As far as it can sound strange, sometimes even exes in people lives as friends is a sign that people really get over each other and was able to give them other meanings.

The reason why is because the trends in gaming changed and people hid their true feelings.\n\nFFXIII just was against the trends at of gaming at the time. Let me run down the list\n\n1: The game is Linear, I admit it could have had more to do but Final Fantasy games have always been linear other games just gave you more illusion of choice. I like that this doesn't waste your time with so much walking. This was around the time of games like GTA and Skyrim.\n\n2: It is a very decadent maximalist game. This was when minimalist games with muted color pallets were all the rage. FFXIII is glossy and colorful. It also is very elegant and almost cosmopolitan in it's look contrasted with the hard boiled macho games of it's day. This even shows in the UI. The UI looks a lot like Fruitger Aero which again was starting to be hated at the time but is seeing a comeback in style\n\n3: It takes itself very seriously, this was at the time when millennial irony was starting to get big and games with a laid back I don't care attitude were all the rage. Think games like GTA and Saints Row. I like that the game takes itself seriously and doesn't wink at the audience constantly.",

I think it\u2019s a shame someone the likes of Jar Jar became the face of his kind and everyone lumps his mannerisms with the rest of the Gungans. Jar Jar was an outcast, and while I think there are over forty ways Lucas could have written him better, he was outcast for being a clowny clutz. The other Gungans are actually competent and we even have cool, disciplined figures like Roos Tarples. Their people made a living amongst giant sea monsters in what can be assumed is one of the most hostile and terrifying oceans known, and I think their unusual fusion between low tech and high tech is fascinating. Their submarines are cool, their cities are breathtaking, and their use of old fashioned catapult alongside electro-plasma orbs and shield batteries is creative.\n\nBut alas, because Jar Jar is a thing, the rest of the Gungans too were thrown into the hate bin along with the Ewoks and relegated to comic relief.

Furthermore being a Disney fan doesn\u2019t necessarily make you a Star Wars fan and vice versa. \n\nDisney keeps tearing down/ rebuilding attractions to replace them with SW themed rides/attractions. It makes more sense to me to build a whole SW themed park and make as many attractions as they want completely separate from their original park. Then SW fans could be submerged into the SW universe without stumbling back into the regular ol Disney cartoonish nostalgia. \n\nI know it costs billions to complete a build this big but they\u2019re Disney, DISNEY!!! they can afford it, they own practically every channel. The park might be alleviated of such heavy traffic yet they would be gaining revenue from 2 separate parks at that point. Also less heavy traffic leads to a better experience for park goers and may lead to them returning more frequently.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if you like SW or not it just doesn\u2019t make sense to me to mash it all together and tear down classics to make way for a franchise they recently acquired.

People on both sides think that collectivism and individualism are mutually exclusive. It goes like this for people who sided with collectivism thinks that if collectivism works in the culture the results will be that the country or society have harmony, social cohesion, be clean interdependence and much more but it will hamper creativity, uniqueness, individual thoughts, innovation and much more. On the other hand, people who sided with individidualism thinks that if individidualism works in the culture the country or society will have creativity, high GDP, innovation, high intellegence and much more but it will hamper, social cohesion, it will have conflicts, the country and cities will be dirty, no teamwork and much more.\u00a0\n\nPeople who sided with collectivism and others who sided with individualism are arguring by giving out reasons why they choose their side.\n\nPeople who sided with collectivism against individualism will say:\n\n\u201cCollectivism is better because it\u2019ll make the country and society be clean, have no conflicts, harmony and much more. While individualism is bad because it\u2019ll make the country and society have conflicts, be dirty, no public property, selfishness and much more. That\u2019s why there are countries and cities that are clean, have selfless people and much more because they value collectivism since it\u2019s superior while individualism is bad for the country and society.\u201d\n\nPeople who sided with individualism against collectivism will say:\n\n\u201cScrew that, individualism is better because it\u2019ll make the country and society have creativity, high GDP, innovation, privacy and much more. While collectivism is bad because it\u2019ll make the country and society have no creativity,\u00a0\u00a0low GDP, no innovation, lack of privacy and much more. This is why America especially hollywood and the UK are big at making movies and tv shows because they value individualism which includes creativity. Germany made advanced technologies because individualism is better which includes innovation. While collectivism is bad for the country and society.\u201d\n\nThis argument is getting out of hand and getting so much debate and it needs to stop because in reality, collectivism and individualism are not mutually exclusive they co exist at the same time within all countries and societies and also these two are not the only reasons why there are countries and societies that are clean, creative, innovative, have harmony, high GDP and much more. It goes like this:\n\n1. America is being proclaimed as Individualistic but in scenarios like construction sites and road work, teamwork is required because it needs a lot of people to build and work there which teamwork is a key point of collectivism, so therefore collectivistic culture exist in America. (Personally it\u2019s safe me to say, America is a collectivistic country or society.)\n2. South Korea is being proclaimed as Collectivstic but in scenarios like making technologies, innovation is required because they want to make technologies advanced and innovative which innovation is a key point of Individualism, so therefore individualistic culture exist there in South Korea.\n3. Sweden is also being proclaimed as Individualistic but the country is also clean and it\u2019s either because of different aspect of culture or policies. So therefore, individualism does not automatically mean the country will be dirty which people think that it\u2019ll make the country dirty but it\u2019s untrue.\n4. Japan is also being proclaimed as collectivism but in scenarios like making video games, anime, TV shows and movies, creativity is required because they want to make these things so creative which creativity is a key point of individualism, so therefore individualism culture exist in Japan.\n\nSo these are the countries I point out that you need to understand that collectivism and individualism are not mutually exclusive but they co exist at the same time even in many countries that are proclaimed as collectivistic and other proclaimed as individualistic. You also gotta understand that collectivism and individualism are not the only reasons why countries and societies are clean, have creativity, innovation, people who wants privacy, high GDP and much more.",

Standalone content that gets a sequel (or many sequels) is not diminished because there exists extra content. Hellraiser comes to mind here, as in my opinion the movies get worse as time goes on (enjoyed the most recent one, though), but the first two are still just as excellent as they ever have been. I enjoy sequels, I like to see where the protagonist goes after the fact, or how the world develops post-incident. If there\u2019s an audience for it, it\u2019s justified.\n\nCriticizing remakes in particular because they weren\u2019t \u201cneeded\u201d doesn\u2019t make any sense to me at all. We remake things because we\u2019re inspired by them and want to reimagine them, or because we think it would be interesting to see how it went if it went slightly differently, or if a role was played by someone who wasn\u2019t around for the original. Not every remake is a hit, or even necessarily good, but I\u2019m usually glad they tried or intrigued to see how it goes when I\u2019m walking into the theater.\n\nAnd look, I\u2019m not naive, I\u2019m well aware that money is a massive driving factor behind these films, and that they\u2019re not all artistic passion projects, but money\u2019s a motivation for a lot of original work too. I don\u2019t think they need to be put on a pedestal, but regardless of why they were made, the final product can still be enjoyed, but these films definitely don\u2019t need to be justified, nor should the be criticized for existing just because there wasn\u2019t an overt need for them.",

        "text": "Just to be clear, I don\u2019t mean the least entertaining, or that she is my least favorite character. I mean out of all people on the show, her moral compass is the most askew. \n\nNow, I know lots of people will rush to say Barney or Ted, and while they aren\u2019t great either (and neither is Robin frankly) in my opinion Lily is far worse than any of them due to her self righteousness. What drives me crazy about her is the way she forces her moral standards and views of the world onto everyone else around her and manipulates the people around her for her own selfish desires, while acting like it\u2019s for their own good. \n\nBefore I get into that I\u2019ll discuss the flaws of other characters. \n\nBarney doesn\u2019t pretend to be a good person. He knows very well that he doesn\u2019t treat women how they should be treated and doesn\u2019t try to pretend to be a good person when he isn\u2019t, and it\u2019s something he really seems to wrestle with and grow from throughout the show as he learns to not be afraid of commitment. (Ignore the last two episodes where him and Robin get divorced. \n\nTed has main character syndrome without a doubt. He takes everything that happens to him as a sign from the universe that this girl is the one. When he likes a girl he expects it to be reciprocal and tries on multiple occasions to go out with women under false pretenses in a Barney like way. Except he\u2019s the \u201cnice guy\u201d and the \u201chopeless romantic\u201d which imo makes him worse than Barney because Barney doesn\u2019t pretend to be something he isn\u2019t. \n\nRobin isn\u2019t exactly a cup of tea either. She knows she can\u2019t give the men in her life (except for Barney) the sort of commitment they would be looking for, so she strings them along instead of being alone so that she can fulfill her short term sexual and romantic desires, and dumps this guys as soon as they stop being easy or as soon as they catch onto robins plan. \n\nMarshall is a good dude. I wish he would condemn Lily\u2019s shittiness more, but other than that no problems with the guy. \n\nIn my opinion, all of that pales in comparison to the terribleness of Lily Aldrin. First let us discuss aldrin justice. She views the world as her kindergarten class, and she is the teacher. If someone does something she views as mean, she has the right to take things from them as a form of justice. The amount of self entitlement, self righteousness, and narcissism it takes to see everyone so far below you that you have the right to correct their behavior by taking away their things is absolutely astonishing. \n\nNext, there is how she enforces this view (and others) on the people around her. Ted almost loses his job because Lily stole his bosses ball. She almost caused issues with the captain when she stole his ashtray.\n\nShe also thinks she is the arbiter of relationships in the people around her. She breaks up Ted and his girlfriends over the course of a decade because she doesn\u2019t like how the women would fit into her life. B it she tells herself (and Ted) when it\u2019s for Ted\u2019s own good, when in reality Lily just doesn\u2019t like them. She kidnaps Robin and Barney until they define the terms of their relationship before they are ready. \n\nWhat annoys me the most is how the show presents Lily, as kind and thoughtful. She is a manipulative narcissist and by far the worst character on the show. ",

They prime us for what\u2019s to come, whether it\u2019s excitement, tension, or nostalgia. Skipping them is like diving into a movie without the opening credits\u2014it feels incomplete.\n\t2.\tCultural Significance: Some intros become iconic in their own right, spawning memes, remixes, and fan art. By skipping them, we miss out on a shared cultural experience that brings fans together.\n\t3.\tCharacter Development: Many intros give us visual cues about character arcs and themes that might not be fully explored in the episode. Skipping them means losing out on those important nuances that enhance our understanding of the story.\n\t4.\tLoss of Ritual: For many of us, the ritual of watching a show includes enjoying the intro. It\u2019s a moment to settle in, grab snacks, and mentally prepare for the episode. Rushing past it feels like we\u2019re in a hurry to finish instead of savoring the experience.\n\t5.\tIt\u2019s a Choice: I get that some people want to binge-watch and maximize their time, but isn\u2019t part of the joy of watching TV to enjoy the journey, not just the destination?\n\nSo, next time you\u2019re tempted to hit that \u201cskip intro\u201d button, consider what you might be missing.

I usually love covers and seeing what other artists do with a concept, but one exception that irks me is the Pentatonix cover of Fleet Foxes White Winter Hymnal. Originally, it was a deep song about innocence and isolation, rooted with folk tones where the singer speaks from the heart; imagery of coldness and snow creating a sort of eeriness. Then Pentatonix makes a vastly over-produced version that has turned the song into a clapping game, like the Cup Song by Anna Kendrick. I will give them credit because they are great singers and can tell they are hitting the harmonies, but I think them choosing to cover that song in this way (overtaking Fleet Foxes in popularity) really removed the soul from it and damaged the meaning of the song to the public eye.",

Like I thought the show was going a way that was truly original and well done and then it goes \u201clol jk it\u2019s vampires\u201d and it drops all subtly in its criticism of religion. And even the commentary on religion is just inconsistent and almost playing favorites. The Chr1st1an organization is depicted as corrupt, manipulative, and evil but for some reason 1slam gets a pass? The mus1im sheriff is a hero who tries to save everyone and at no point questions his own faith. His son leaves 1slam and because of it he ends up dying but not before converting back to 1slam. Like how are you going to have a show that is a blatant critique on religion but not criticize one of the most oppressive religions and instead depict it in a very positive light? In fact it isn\u2019t \u201calmost playing favorites\u201d it is playing favorites. \n\nIt\u2019s been a while since I saw the show but I also remember the group of heroes at the end also behaving in really dumb ways that would have got them caught by the towns folk in any competently written story.

I just finished a tough interval training session on the track a few days ago, and I was anything but bored. My legs were burning, I was gasping hard, and it took a great degree of mental effort to finish the whole workout. The post-workout euphoria was great. If I had to describe that workout, I would say it was challenging and rewarding. Definitely not boring.\n\nI also don't find longer, slower paced runs boring, as they give me a good opportunity to organise my thoughts, reflect on past events, and process things that have happened to me recently. In today's society, people are almost constantly scrolling on their phones, and most rarely get the opportunity to simply sit in silence with their thoughts. A long, easy run gives me the chance to do just that, while providing health and fitness benefits at the same time.\n\nWhat I like about running is how convenient it is. You don't need to buy a bike, you don't need to travel to a location that has a pool, all you need are a pair of shoes and you're ready to go. You also don't need to master any complicated skills; most people can run with passable form. You can easily adjust the intensity of your workout. Want something light? Just jog slowly. Want to go harder? You can easily push yourself to your absolute limit with some interval sprints.  To me, running is simply the best form of cardio because of how accessible, versatile, and effective it is. ",

        "text": "I even like some live-action adaptations, but animation is the best format to adapt anything related to comics, games, literary sagas, etc. Here are my arguments:\n\n1. Live-action tends to become outdated quickly because depending on when you watch it, the effects might have already aged. Even some of today's live-actions suffer a bit from cheap CGI, and with the amount of money spent, they could have made an animation that, even if simple, would still be great.\n2. Animations can make characters extremely faithful to the original works they are based on. I find it really strange, for example, to watch *The Last of Us* and see characters that don\u2019t resemble those from the game. While people might love that series, I don't enjoy it as much. But aside from that, which is considered good, the best video game adaptations have been done in animation.\n3. Cartoons never age. Look at the upcoming *Harry Potter* series, for example. They're looking for a 10-year-old actor to match the first book. However, a season of a series takes much longer to produce than a movie (considering a cinematic budget). So at some point, we'll find it odd that the actor's age doesn't match the character, like what happened with *Stranger Things* (even though that show wasn't based on anything).\n4. Live-actions are limited. As good as CGI effects can be nowadays, nothing beats the creative freedom and infinite possibilities that animation offers.\n\nAll that being said, I wish many of today's projects were done in animation. I would love it if the MCU movies were animated. Imagine being able to make the characters look exactly like they do in the comics without coming across as awkward, like in some films. Imagine how amazing the Dungeons & Dragons movie would be if it were animated. Or a fully animated series based on the Harry Potter books. I get the commercial side of it, I believe live-actions attract more viewers. But if we consider quality alone, animation is superior in every way, and I don\u2019t understand why people get hyped when something is announced as a live-action adaptation (especially of games). Hollywood has managed to implant this live-action culture, and now people will accept any awkward as long as it's packed with CGI. And I'll go further, maybe my most unpopular opinion of all: as much as I like *The Lord of the Rings* movies, I would love to see an adaptation of the books completely redone in animation.",

Not only did his voice sound amazing live, but towards the end of the video at around 3:21 he howls this line which gave me goosebumps: \u201cAnd I\u2019m *FREE* fallin\u2019, fallin\u2019\u201d Moments like these made this version of the song more emotional and raw compared to the radio edit of the original that\u2019s been played for decades. I wish John Mayer\u2019s version of \u201cFree Fallin\u2019\u201d received more attention because I don\u2019t think the original has much passion in its execution. \n\n",

The problem is, the people behind those sources often don\u2019t receive any credit or compensation.

It is so drawn out, and so, so boring. It could have been 1 map and 10 hours of active gameplay, but instead it is 30 maps and 100 hours of shit. \n\nIt was released in 2009. Bioshock 1, Half-Life 2, Halo 3, several COD games, and loads of other FPS titles had established the conventions we still use years before. Making it function the way it does would have been harder than just making it in a way we already know is fun, and it's not like the variety the guns (are supposed to) have would needed any of that to be reworked. \n\nThe entire game feels like it wasn't built for its own mechanics, it's a mish-mash of ideas that are fun in isolation but somehow they have built in every contradiction there is to make those mechanics as unenjoyable as possible. \n\nIt isn't a good game, my time with it is some of the least fun I have ever had in my life, and I genuinely do not understand how it got released at all, let alone how it got a sequel (no hate to BL2 tho, I quite liked it).

For the first two minutes, I thought it was pretty good. Such dark lyrics, and a great guitar riff.\n\nUnfortunately, my excitement went away when it got to the \"Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?\" part. I don't remember how I reacted to it, but it really took me out of the song. When the song finally ended, I got confused. Is 'Bohemian Rhapsody' one song? Or three songs? And why did the tone change all of a sudden?\n\nAfter I finished, I never listened to it again. I would hear the song on occasions whether I'd be in an area where music is played on the speakers, or whenever one of my school teachers would play music. As I grew older, I began to not hate it as much, but when I would listen to the song, I would only play the ballad part.\n\nIt's now 2024, and I still only listen to the ballad part (+ the ending \"nothing really matters\" lyrics. 'Cause why not). Funny enough, I've listened to fan-edited versions of the song on YouTube (where it's just the ballad) more than the actual official upload.\n\nBefore anyone comes up with any conclusions, let me settle the deal. Just because I'm not a fan of 'Bohemian Rhapsody'. that doesn't mean I don't like 'Queen'. In fact, one of my favorite songs of all time is a Queen song (It's A Kind Of Magic). I just think that their most popular song is weirdly structured, changes tone too quickly, and it's quite bizarre. This is where I give my props to Queen, as for their Live Aid performance, they only played the ballad. Although, I have to assume that they didn't play the rest of the song because of the time-limit each performer of the concert had.\n\nStrangely, however. I did eventually find the second half of the song to be slightly better when it's performed live. I'm not a fan of the original studio version, but I did find myself like the second half more in life performances, and i guess it's because it feels more like a transition to song, and it has more fan interaction.\n\nAnyways, that is my unpopular opinion.",

We have Planet Hulk and Ragnarok in the same movie. These are two of the story lines in the comics that represent the worst days in these characters lives. Hulk finally found peace and lost everything that he ever cared about. Thor is seeing the death of every friend, family member, and even place that he grew up around. It's all played for laughs. The fact that the MCU is so afraid to show any actual emotion or remorse and has to pull its punches with a joke every ten seconds did both of these story lines a disservice and Taika Waititi deserved a movie more geared towards his brand of comedy instead of being forced to turn what should be one of the most devastating and heartfelt MCU movies into a screwball comedy.

For clarity and elaboration, I know that governors to mandate a cars speed exist, but I am advocating for this effect to be not optional but mandatory for every road vehicle, ideally manufactured in such a way where removal or tampering results in failure of the engine. Any race vehicle without one should be limited to the tracks only. \n\nPeople seem to be interpreting this as me trying to prevent people from speeding? No where in my post did I say that. With a cap of 100 miles an hour people can still speed in pretty much every existing zone. That\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying at all.

So, instead of going on the grocery store and loading up for a family of four once a week, you swing by the grocery store on the way home from work and grab something for dinner. It also allows food to be fresher and generally of higher quality since you aren't having to stock up for a week or two.\n\nAlso, the definition of a walkable community is that schools are of walkable distance OR connected by transportation. \n\nBut also, professional city/urban planners seem to idiotically fundamentally misunderstand walkable communities. In Texas at least their definition is a bunch of expensive apartments with high priced restaurants and bars underneath. Which... cool... but that isn't walkable if you still have to drive 30 minutes to a grocery store or to school or to entertainment or to recreation.\n\nAlso many of these walkable communities seem to be designed to be as hot as possible, big cement buildings, huge parking lots, zero trees. Just by eliminating giant flat fields of cement and making sure walkways were adequately shaded, a-lot of summer heat can be mitigated. \n\nBut it seems alot of Americans, and architects/city planners/urban planners, have zero idea what they are talking about in regards to walkable communities.",

        "text": "IMPORTANT EDIT PLEASE READ: I thought this'd be obvious, but I've had many people comment about it. I believe that people who are UNWILLING to donate organs shouldn't recieve them. NOT UNABLE. If you have an issue with your organs, you should obviously still be able to recieve them, because organ donors would be literally useless otherwise.\n\nIn the UK, if you die in an accident like a car crash, the government automatically has permission to extract your organs, because they can be used to save people's lives. However, you can opt out of donating your own tissue/organs if you want.\n\nI believe that if you specifically opt out of donating an organ when you die, you shouldn't be allowed to recieve one from a stranger. For example, if you opt out of donating your kidneys when you die, the government should prioritise giving kidneys to people who are willing to donate their own instead of you in case of emergency.\n\nOf course, if there were no donors who needed organs, then you can give them to the non-donors. But that's a useless thing to consider, as there will always be more people who need organs than organs themselves. You could just consider my opinion to be putting non-donors at the bottom of the list, but they'll never make it to the top of that list anyway.\n\nI'd definitely also allow people donating organs to science to recieve them. Either way, you're donating your organs to potentially save other lives.\n\nThe entire idea of nationalised healthcare is that everyone puts a little in, and then you can take a little out if you need it. This should also apply to organs.",

It's even worse if there is little green space near the apartment. Occasionally taking your \"doggo\" to a dog park doesn't make up for this.\n\nSecond, it's unfair to your neighbors. Dogs bark, they run around, they occasionally can be a nuisance. That's OK, it's in their nature, but subjecting other people in close proximity to that on a regular basis is inconsiderate.\n\nThird, it's unfair to building management, maintenance, and cleaning staff. Accidents happen, but those accidents are usually not cleaned by the owners. Instead, cleaning and maintenance staff usually have to clean it. Additionally, management often have to arbitrate disputes between residents regarding noise, smell, etc.\n\nFourth (this is where it really gets unpopular), it's unfair to the landlord (if the resident is renting). Most dogs will cause wear and tear to the apartment and possibly some damage. Even additional pet fees usually don't cover repairs.\n\nI post this out of love for dogs.",

I have gone through periods of growing it out to see any potential benefits or preferences, and these are the top 5 things that I've learned about not having armpit hair\n\n> I sweat a lot less.  Like, a ton less\n\n> B.O. is naturally a lot weaker \n\n> I require a lot, lot, lot less deodorant \n\n> Deodorant works far better and for much longer \n\n> If I'm hot, it's easier to cool my armpits down / aerate them.  Consequently, for whatever reason you might think of, sweat evaporates from my armpits more quickly \n\nTo be fair, I find armpit hair to be especially disgusting.  It's thin and strangly and has the appearance of an unkempt dead rat\n\nApparently, someone that swings their arms a lot when they walk can suffer from greater irritation if they shave their arms, but arm swinging while walking is a different topic \n\nIn my opinion, it can be acceptable for someone to trim their armpit hair.

        "text": "So, I've been job hunting for three months now, and it's been really hard on me. So, far I've had four interviews, and since I live with my parents I don't have any expenses, I shouldn't be complaining, but I am. Interviews take a long time to prepare, every single one of those interviews I had to shave and really prepare myself mentally. Like getting prepared dress wise for an interview can just be exhausting task, and a lot of times that labor isn't even recognized.   Out of four of the interviews I got rejected from two of them and the other two are pending. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, since the company is taking soo much of your time for an interview, as preparation and if any of you have read some of the stories from r/recruitinghell, you would know it's not easy to to get a job and some of those stories are just downright frightening. Also getting to the interview stage is itself an accomplishment, as there are soo many ghosting and rejections.  I've applied to nearly 50 jobs and I still am unemployed. It would be nice if I were to get financial recompensation for interviewing as in that's the whole purpose of getting a job. In some cases the money spent on the interview such as attire and transportation would still surpass the payment from the interview as some people would spend probably over $100 just for a suit and tie and maybe another $50 for transportation, meaning a $50 check would still be better than nothing. For those people saying \"it's my job to present myself as best as possible, and it's not the job for the company to care\" the company  can reject whom ever they want before the interview, just based on the resume and the cover letter and that's happened to me soo many times. \n\nAdditionally some interviewers don't represent the company well, the last one just gave me a tour and didn't ask qualitative questions if the interviewee was getting paid they would have take that time more seriously. Now to be fair some interviewers are fair, but they're just HR representatives that know jack shit about the position. In my humble opinion it would be more practical to make the boss better at interviewing than make HR representatives be more knowledgeable of how to recruit people for positions that they know nothing about. Sorry about that tangent.  Out of all four of the interviews I actually only had one interview where the people knew how to interview and they knew what the job entailed and I got rejected from this job.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLong story short, I'd feel a bit more respected and valued if I were to get paid. We unfortunately live in a society where the corporations and the owner class can do whatever they want, with the addition of the culture and the media being submissive to that. I mean if I can't get the job, I should at least be recognized for the effort that I made for getting to the job, as in I every single time I get rejected while having been in an interview it's an awful kind of feeling. I also would like to be getting some form of money for my troubles.",

Yes, it's free, but basically what you're doing when you open an account is giving someone else your money to \"use\" for their own business. This is why I believe banks should be operated without the need for extra funds because they're already taking everyone else's money to begin with, but it's not like they can just magically say there's more in existence because of the \"gold standard\" right? Oh, wait... They can do that, but that would require the government to do a tiny amount more work where they already do none. Fiat money imo is a way of just keeping the poor poor, but I digress.\n\nThe reality of the matter is, is the money doesn't even really exist because money is only money because a government said it is. So there's realistically no reason for the banks to \"need\" to make money if the government would actually be helpful for once and give them the resources to be non-profit. Technically speaking the government could print more money to specifically put in banks, and just \"decree\" that it is legal tender. \n\nBut, asking for non-profit necessary services in the USA is basically asking for way too much, even though other countries can do similar things with next to no issue... Perks of being American, where you can see so many things that can be improved for the rest of society yet you can't do shit because you've been kept in poverty through no fault of your own!\n\nEdit: Not really sure how this gained so much traction.

Glue traps and poison cause days worth of the animal dying slowly ripping itself apart, starving or bleeding out to death. Poison causing Internal bleeding, organs shutting down slowly for up to 10 days before they die. imagine being in that pro longed immense pain and tell me why any animal deserves that. I literally couldn't gaf about your disease scare mongering either, that's not an excuse for your shitty treatment towards them and its been proved they are not more likely to carry disease than any other animal or human so you have the same chance of catching disease from them as you are catching it from anything. they deserve better and if you disagree you're apart of the problem and the reason I'm even making this post. Ik a lot of people will continue to laugh at the thought of caring about things other than themselves but I wont stop speaking up for those who are  tortured to death. ",

But I've seen way too many cases where students were denied bathroom breaks and either messed themselves in the classroom, or got a bad infection from holding in their waste for too long. This is especially dangerous for student's who use tampons as TSS is an often deadly disease you can get from leaving it inside too long. \nIf teachers are legally responsible for their students, I think leaving the classroom to relieve yourself without asking is way less dangerous as opposed to a student dying under their teacher's watch because of a damn tampon",

Sure, some people are assholes, but these aren't people worthy of attention anyway. \n\nOverall, I don't think it is that bad to be ugly, and whenever someone tries to insult another person calling them that I think it is pretty stupid.

        "text": "Before y\u2019all hop into the comments telling me how wrong I am, let me explain my argument. I am NOT saying that your travel experiences make you unattractive. I\u2019m not even saying that liking to travel is bad.\n\nWhat I AM saying is that many women on dating apps (I\u2019m not sure if this is sex-specific, do men do this too?) have travel all over their profiles. Pictures of themselves kayaking in the jungle. Pictures of themselves in front of the Great Pyramids. And so forth. And then you read through their profile, and they say their biggest hobbies and goals involve travel. That they took a year off work to travel the world. That they\u2019re looking for a travel partner, and so forth.\n\nSo anyway. If that\u2019s legitimately what you truly love and that\u2019s a big part of your personality, more power to you. But I can\u2019t help but wonder if you\u2019re doing/saying all this because you think it\u2019s attractive or it makes you interesting. Because it doesn\u2019t IMO.\n\nHonestly, if I see someone who seems obsessed with travel, it\u2019s kind of a red flag. Traveling is fun for sure, but I don\u2019t want a \u201ctravel partner.\u201d I want a wife. I want to settle down and have children. And I know I\u2019m not the only one. I also want someone who\u2019s responsible with money, not someone who\u2019s going to blow all of our life savings to go to Paris. I\u2019d rather save that money to send out future children to a private school, or save it for retirement when we actually CAN travel without having to lose our jobs\u2014because we don\u2019t have jobs anymore.\n\nI dunno. Maybe that makes me boring. But your obsession with travel and being willing to risk losing your job to go on a year long African safari just seems irresponsible to me, and that\u2019s kind of unattractive to me. But that\u2019s just me. It also sounds exhausting, both mentally and physically. ",

Unless you have a specific allergy, spicy food doesn't make you ill, the amount you're jamming down your gullet does.  Which leads me to my next point. \n\nAlmost everything on the menu at  Taco Bell can be ordered with grilled chicken instead of admittedly greasy ground beef.  Then it's topped with lettuce and tomato.  If you went home, grilled some chicken and served it with fresh chopped lettuce and tomato, you'd say you made a healthy meal, but for some reason because it comes in a paper bag we hate it.  \n\nNow where I think people go wrong is how MUCH they order.  Taco Bell has the blessing and curse of being exceptionally cheap.   However, the average 10 dollar meal box you can order pre set is 1000 calories or less.  Not great, but have water instead of soda, again, go for chicken instead of beef, decent meal.  It's when you order the box.  Plus an extra couple of tacos, plus another crunch wrap, plus the weird burrito they have ads for (there's only so many ways you can toast a burrito folks, stop trying to be fancy), then try to eat this all at once, then wonder why you're sweating and your stomach hurts.

So many wonderful English style cheeses.  Scones with British clotted cream and jams made in the UK were to die for.  Full English breakfasts with blood pudding, sausages, and even the beans were delicious.  They even take way more consideration into the type of cut they use for bacon.  So many other British foods were amazing from the meat pies to the pub foods we had tried.  And no, this wasn\u2019t just in London, we traveled all throughout the countryside, to Bath and Oxford too and had great food everywhere.  I really think the Brits have stepped up their food game. Even their traditional foods they often get made fun of for were superbly good and delicious at many places. Desserts and pastries were just in a whole different level. The Brits definitely spare no calories due to worry over fat, lol.   British food = bad is now an outdated stereotype.  \n\n\nAnd yes, I used UK/British/England interchangeably in this post because I\u2019m a dumb American and don\u2019t care.

If everyone understands that is not the case, we need to be more open to dating people in that situation. There is nothing wrong with being a bit patient and moving out together eventually.\n\nIn fact, I'd say there are cases (some, by no means all) where a young person living on their own can even be a red flag if their parents kicked them out due to horrid behaviour or if they moved out because they are too into partying and too independent. These can be bad traits on someone you may marry someday.\n\nSo it is not like someone living on their own is AUTOMATICALLY a better partner than someone who doesn't. And I don't think it should be treated that way and it often is.",

But there's something that's been bothering me lately\u2014this idea that you can backpack through Africa and still expect to have an amazing safari experience. Let's be real: African safaris are not cheap, and they\u2019re not meant to be.\n\nEvery now and then, I see people arriving here on a shoestring budget, expecting to do a full safari experience, and then they get upset when they realize it\u2019s expensive. They complain about how locals see them as \"walking money\" or how everything is overpriced. Newsflash: safaris are a luxury experience, not a backpacking adventure. \n\nIf you're broke or just trying to stretch your dollars as much as possible, Africa, especially for safaris, is probably not the best choice for you. There are plenty of other regions\u2014like Southeast Asia\u2014where you can backpack on a budget and still have a fantastic experience.\n\nAfrica is rich in wildlife, culture, and experiences that are truly once-in-a-lifetime. But those experiences come at a cost, and that cost is what helps sustain the local communities and protect the wildlife. So, if you're planning a trip to Africa, especially for a safari, be prepared to spend. If not, maybe reconsider your destination.\n",

My neighbour got married at 31 lived with his parents and wife till he was 41 rent free. Worked 2 jobs while his parents took care of his children. He saved enough money to build a large house on a farm. My dad never moved out of his parents house. when he immigrated to Canada he built a 9 bed 7 bath together with his parents. They got married my mother moved in. Culturally I'm expected to not me out as I'm an only child it would be frowned upon if I moved out and rented a place. Unless I went to work in a different city. Most people of other cultures such as hispanics Asians arabs find it very cool and amazing that my dad lives with his parents while white Americans/ canadians. Make fun of him. Generally in my culture and most others. If your not married and live/work in the same city you should live with your parents untill you get married (It would be okay to move out after collage if your parents lived in a 3 bedroom townhouse and you have 5 brothers). While living at your parents you shouldn't pay any rent and save atleast half of your salary so once you get married you can purchase your own house. my moms co worker is 52 he lives in his mothers basement with his wife and kids. In a suit most people in the culture would say why the hell would he move and and rent his own place if he can't afford to purchase. Why would you want to live in some one else's basement instead of your own parents basement. I'm not here to judge anyone's culture or way of life everyone has their choice but it just bothers me how living with your parents is frowned upon and seen as better to move out and rent some one else's house rather then live at home!? \n",

I was expecting it to be this terrible, super complicated thing, because I always heard everyone complaining about it (\"it\" being wait time in lines and having to take everything off. SPECIFICALLY THAT PART IS WHAT THIS OPINION IS ABOUT, NOT ANY OUTSIDE CIRCUMSTANCES). Really, it was just a matter of finding where the map was (which is very easy to do, because they have maps everywhere in the main terminal areas), and a lot of waiting in line. The security wasn't even as complicated as people make it seem, it's just putting your stuff in buckets and taking an extra 45 seconds to walk through a detector. As long as you have all of the stuff you need (ID and plane ticket) ready with you, and as long as you don't have anything you can't legally bring on the flight, the biggest \"issue\" is just lines. And if you make sure to get there with time to spare, lines making you late doesn't have to be anything close to a worry.\n\nSo, in my opinion, people who make a big fuss about airports and security are just being dramatic because they're impatient or have poor time management and always get there late.\n\nEDITED FOR CLARITY: I had intended for this post to target people who solely bitch about all of the waiting in line and having to take all their stuff off. Entirely my fault for not specifying that originally. Obviously a special case is a special case, and there's a shit ton of other issues with the system. The specific part of the subject my opinion is mainly related to is when someone goes, \"I was at the airport 2 hours early and the lines still almost made me late! \\*surprised Pikachu face here\\*\" like that's surprising or, \"oh my god I STILL had to take off all my stuff at the airport like everyone always talks about and expects!\"  \n\n\n2nd Edit: I'm appreciating a lot of the discussions this post is spawning.

        "text": "To start, id just like to say that I know working a 9-5 has its downsides, and it\u2019s often incredibly stressful for a lot of people. Every job is difficult to some capacity - if you wouldn\u2019t do it for free, then it\u2019s hard. No one likes work, unless you\u2019re one of the 1% who managed to find a job doing something you love. I am not trying to make anyone\u2019s suffering seem insignificant. I\u2019m trying to offer perspective.\n\nI have started to notice a trend amongst both the people I know who work office jobs, as well as on here. This idea that working a 9-5 is \u2018literal hell\u2019 and \u2018inhumane\u2019. \n\nI simply do not understand.\n\nWorking as a kitchen manager, I spent at least 40 hrs/wk standing in a 45+ degree (celsius) kitchen, with no air conditioning, no ventilation other than the smoke extraction fans, wearing fire/grease-proof pants, an apron, grease-proof boots, and gloves. I spent an additional 15-20 hrs/wk prepping, cleaning, ordering ingredients, having meetings, fixing shit that broke, rostering shifts, and dealing with incident reports, as well as being a part-time pseudo-accountant for the owner. I know many other kitchen workers who\u2019s lives are unbelievably hard, much harder than mine.\n\nWhen I was a drillers Offsider (reverse circulation), THAT was close to hell. To those of you who know what being an RC drillers Offsider entails, you know exactly what I mean. Your standard uniform is long hi-vis pants, a long sleeve hi-vis shirt, thick gloves, thick socks, steel toe boots, a neck-sleeve, safety glasses, and a hard hat. You\u2019re working in often 50+ celsius heat, in the middle of the West Australian desert, for 12-14 hours per day, for between 2-4 weeks in a row, with about 1-2 weeks off rotation. Winter is often minus 5-10ish. The job, at its most basic, is sprinting (and I mean sprinting) back and forth, organising/carrying 30kg-70kg bags of dirt and mud, all day every day. You work with drug addicts, ex-felons, and often with people who are extremely low-IQ (not most, but some). Every day is waking up at 3:30am, start at 4am, back to camp by 5pm, repeat.\n\nWorking as a bartender, I spend 40hrs per week living in the night time. Most people wouldn\u2019t believe how bad the sleep schedule for the average bartender is. I sleep during the day, even on my days off (Sunday and Monday), and in total I probably sleep about 40hrs/wk. I have been in fights, called the police at least once a week every week, been threatened with needles, seen people been glassed, and been sexually harassed/assaulted many times. I once had to help a 13 year old girl who was drugged and nearly raped, called the ambos and her parents. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to post about how \u2018tough\u2019 I am, or how \u2018hard\u2019 my life is. I\u2019m trying to understand why people think that 9-5 work is difficult. The friends I have who are in \u2018entry level\u2019 office jobs get paid ~$75k/yr, sit in air conditioned offices, wake up at a gorgeous 6-7am, have regular schedules (which I am unbelievably envious of), and have weekends free. I, and many I know, get paid half of that, and easily work just as hard if not harder.\n\nFrom my point of view, the 9-5 life is a dream I, and a lot of people I know, deeply envy. It\u2019s not hell. To many I know, it seems like paradise.\n\nEdit: I would just like to say, thank you all for the responses, both positive and negative. I understand this is quite an unpopular opinion (hence the subreddit), and I\u2019m glad the discourse was relatively civil. I\u2019ve seen about 50/50 positive to negative replies. Not that I\u2019m keeping score.\n\nI would also like to say: I made this post in a very different state of mind that I am in now. I posted this when I was quite angry, at 2:30am after a late bartending shift (and after a few drinks, not that that\u2019s an excuse). If I had known it would blow up like this, I would have worded it very differently. I still hold my opinion, however, I will concede that I took it too far with my own personal comparisons; comparing my life to others is, and always will be, a totally false equivalence. I made this post as a rant, and it came out very aggressive and accusatory, and hence inflammatory. I apologise for that, genuinely. \n\nIf I could clarify it further without adding my own personal bullshit into it, it would be as such - I think the hyperbole of describing a 9-5, specifically an office job, as \u2018literal hell\u2019, and \u2018inhumane\u2019, the *vast* majority of the time, is totally absurd. Life, as a general rule, is really fucking hard for everyone. But the fact that some things are harder, and objectively worse, than other things, does not invalidate others experiences. \n\nI would, and I know just about every person on this planet, would rather work in an office bored out of their mind, than work in a cobalt mine, or be drafted into a war. Let alone most general labour jobs or hospitality/kitchen jobs. \n\nThis isn\u2019t a \u2018quit yer yappin\u2019 post. You\u2019re allowed to hate your job and complain. But the ridiculous notion that your 9-5 office job is somehow a violation of human rights is downright disgusting. ",

        "text": "This movie is pretty much like a pilot for a TV series. I'd say, even worse.\n\nThe first act was long... long, it just doesn't end. I was almost going to leave the cinema, because it refused to go anywhere. Then, it suddenly explodes, and lots of unconsequential things happen one after the next, just to keep the energy high. And that's the only reason this happens, because I'm sure we won't be seeing half of the things that were shown in the movie until this point in the next movie. Because it's clear that they will make multiple movies for this series.\n\nThe overal thread between all these \"happenings\" is the multiverse stuff, but I still find it a very weak thread. It requires you to *love* Marvel movies, and by proxy to accept that they have spent all their ideas and require bringing up the concept of time and multiverse travel in order to keep things interesting. If you've been around long enough in this world, you'd know by know that is the first signal that they're desperate to milk a dead cow into annihilation.\n\nThat's one thing. The other one is that you're constantly presented with an undefinite amount of plot points that never get solved. First, you're presented with The Spot, which becomes extremely powerful... and then no one speaks of him again. Then, Miguel O'Hara is another sort of Villain, and he should be the true villain of the movie... except this is also interrupted only to end the movie with the protagonist ending up in another universe where you're shown ANOTHER VILLAIN in the last 5 minutes, and the movie ends there.\n\nThis movie is constantly presenting you mcguffin after mcguffin, plot elements hanging loose just to let them... hang lose like that. The main issue with this pretend movie is that you paid a ticket to see a gigantic trailer for the next 3 movies. If you want to get the whole of your ticket's worth, you HAVE to watch the next movies as well, because the time you spent watching this one alone is pointless, worthless. The entire movie is a cliffhanger, with an incredibly furstrating and unsatisfactory edging. A movie whose only reason is to create hype for the next movies.\n\nYou didn't watch a movie, but *the promise of a good movie*. That doesn't sit well with me at all. It's like a videogame with stupid microtransactions: it's implicit that I won't get back my money's worth unless I spend other money just to have a remotely satisfactory experience.\n\nHollywood is trying to milk the audience dry, and they won't be satisfied until ALL MOVIES at the cinema are precisely like that. I think the age of endless franchises has to come to an end.\n\nEDIT:  \nI wish there was a way to differentiate those who agree with me vs those who disagree with me between the upvotes. It would be interesting, it's probably 50/50.\n\nEDIT2:\n\n***Gwen is the true main character. Miles and Gwen have satisfying character arcs:***\n\nIt doesn't stand up for the simple reason that Miles gets all of the main conflicts in the whole movie. All the anthagonists have beef with him, not with Gwen. On top of that, he gets the majority of screentime compared to her. So, she's a main character, but a secondary one. Miles is still the protagonist of the movie.\n\nOn top of that, as I wrote somewhere else, her conflict is barely touched upon and it's started and resolved in just two scenes. One at the very beginning, one at the very end. Her father goes from wanting to arrest her, to having changed his mind, and in the middle of that there's a whole lot of nothing if not the occasional \"dad hates me\". And that's that. That's the character development and your resolution. Two scenes, about 6 minutes in total? Maybe even less. Meanwhile, Miles' family relationship gets a good chunk of the focus in the first act's runtime. And what we get as a resolution is him changing his mind about keeping his identity a secret at the very end of the movie.\n\nMoreover, These:  \n*-Gwen is in conflict with her father at the beginning, they make peace by the end.*  \n*-Miles wants to keep his identity a secret, but then changes his mind by the end.*\n\n...these are Ideas, not character arcs. I could do the same with The Lord of The Rings:  \n*-Legolas hates dwarves at the beginning of the saga. He doesn't hate them anymore and befriends one by the end.*\n\nThat's an idea. What matters more than anything is the execution. Rememember that spanish miss who ruined the Jesus murale of her local church? The intention was to restore a painting of the Christ, but we don't judge the outcome of her efforts by the idea, or the intention. We judge the execution, and her execution was awful.\n\nTo me, the same goes with this movie. Of course, we're talking about extremely competent people in this case.\n\nWhat about the other events? One villain is presented, and then disappears mid movie. The Mumbattan moment exists pretty much in a vacuum to justify Spot getting higher powers. Then, O'Hara is revealed to be an anthagonist/villain. Chase scene. Then, another anthagonist/villain still, shown during the last 10 minutes (even less) of the movie. I find the whole thing extremely weak, you're constantly dished new stuff, moment after moment. It's filled to the brim with fan-service and references, it's chock-full of new stuff that is constantly poured in and neither the chracters nor the plot are ever fleshed out at all.\n\nBear this in mind: you know Gwen emotionally from the first movie, but to know her backstory you need a *very quick* summary of her life at the beginning of ATSV. They get rid of her backstory in about 5 minutes. Almost as an afterthought.",

If it was something serious like a job or something, yeah you would be a idiot for giving up too soon, but at least for me is perfectly acceptable give up on something fun because you're not having fun.\n\nAlso, while it's true that you need to invest time to get good at things, you need to get some bang for your buck too. I think puting dozens if not hundreds of hours of your limited free time trying to get better at something that isn't even that important to you **and still getting mediocre results** is much more foolish than simply cutting loses. For example, when I was younger I spent 5 years trying to learn how to play the guitar. Never earned a single song in full even though a praticed regularly. If I've given up the first time I tought I was getting nowhere, It would have saved me a lot of trouble.",

It\u2019s truly very extremely subjective and it depends on the settings you are in. \n\nYour face is literally evidence of thousands of years of your features being loved. \n\n\nHere comes a personal example from today: \n\nEthnically, I am Venezuelan/Colombian, and as my fellow Latinos are aware, the Latin American beauty standard is impossible. in my family's view, I'm considered mid at best. However, I receive considerable attention elsewhere. Today, during a university conference, the professor couldn't seem to stop looking at  me. I feared I might be in trouble\u2026.. as I may have done something I shouldn\u2019t have done and maybe he noticed. \n\nI anticipated reprimand after class, but that didn\u2019t happen, He shook my hand and thanked me for attending his conference he also said it was lovely to have me there. Later, on the bus home, a man kept glancing back at me. I felt a bit apprehensive, but he didn't seem dangerous. My paranoid mind, attributing it to him being a man, triggered some concern. When I wanted to exit, he realized he was blocking my way and uttered, \"sorry, beautiful,\" which caught me off guard. My boyfriend often asserts that I'm the most beautiful girl he's ever met, but he says it out of love.\n\nI guess because of the way I was raised I don\u2019t believe I am good looking. But I know that is the case with many people So!\n\n if no one told you this today\u2026.\n\nI am here to say that ***you are beautiful***, sometimes we can be in settings where we are considered ugly. But we are not, we are way more attractive than we may think. \n\nHave a great day everyone\n\nEdit:\n\n- Hello everyone! I just woke up and saw the post which is a direct reaction to my own. I made a comment, I hope OP sees it. I am sorry for being colorblind to some peoples lived experiences, I never meant to hurt anyone and  in the deepest posible sentiment I say that ***they are right.*** For some people their reaction post is true, there are some really terrible people who treat others badly just for not liking their appearances. And I can\u2019t deny their lived experiences, I didn\u2019t think of it while making the post. I believe everyone is beautiful but that\u2019s not always a popular opinion. \n\n**But he\u2019s not right for the vile things he messaged me on my dms.**\n\nI am glad for every single person my post has helped and I am sorry for those this post has offended. \n \n\n\nEdit: for privately reasons I will remove some personal information from my post ",

The trend of shortening phrases and words has gone too far when we can't even say two simple words.\r  \n\r  \nOrange juice is a classic beverage, enjoyed by many around the world, and it deserves to be called by its full name. Saying \"OJ\" doesn't save much time, and it comes off as trying too hard to be casual or cool. It's as if people are taking a simple pleasure and turning it into something more complicated than it needs to be.\r  \n\r  \nI understand that language evolves and that abbreviations can be useful, but I believe there should be a limit. We don't shorten other drink names like apple juice or grape juice, so why do it with orange juice? It's a small thing, but it's a trend that I find unnecessary and slightly annoying.\r  \n\r  \nWhy OJ? Do you want to sound cool? Is it so much of a hustle to say orange juice? Do you abbreviate apple juice too? \" Hey yeah, let me have some AJ?\" - said by no one ever. I just think it sound annoying af.",

Ofcourse, a clear explanation of this would be that the majority of the \"vocal\" audience on the internet falls in the 16-24 age group, and the older you get; the less inclined you are to comment on random videos.\n\nSo, for this young demographic, of course 30 would be old and anything over 40 would be ancient.\n\nHowever, the problem arises when people start to believe it quite literally and adopt this mentality into their daily life. I've seen many people in the mid to late 30s and early 40s age group complain about being old and it being \"too late\" for them to change their life around.\n\nThis is absolute nonsense as far as I am concerned, especially regarding the matter of fitness. 30s are actually supposed to be the prime of your life; you are experienced and mature enough to not make the silly mistakes that you did in your 20s \u2013 yet you are still fit, athletic and healthy enough to engage in any physical activity you want. \n\nSure, there are people who get terrible joint and knee problems in their 30s, but that is a reflection of their poor lifestyle choices catching up to them \u2013 one can't keep getting away with bad lifestyle choices forever. Besides, the modern sedentary lifestyle is not very fitness friendly.\n\nIf you stay reasonably fit, active and injury free, then your body won't really start breaking down until your 60s \u2013 if even that! \n\nSo, all in all, 30s and 40s are actually the prime of your life, as you have the happy medium between fitness, mental maturity and wisdom.\n\nConsidering oneself old in one's 30s and 40s is a defeatist mentality.\n\nBefore you assume that I am some middle aged person going on a rant; let me tell you that I am not.\nI am 22, and I've seen firsthand how people's lives get better and more fulfilling in their 30s and 40s \u2013 especially if they look after their health.\n\nSo, it bothers me when people get in this defeatist mindset.",

Therefore, almost everything people read or watch when they mindlessly surf the web is fake content, staged videos, fake clickbaity information, photoshopped/filtered people dancing in skimpy outfits, and/or rage-bait videos. Good content doesn't last - social media websites tend to remove older videos from our feed regardless of their quality, so the creators always have to come up with new videos or posts, they keep repeating the tricks that got them views for their older videos, which means that you can see the same staged argument or stupid dance, again and again, coming from the same creators.

As result, people have also lost the ability to point out something negative while still having respect and love for that person.\n\nThe heart of a roast was always that the participants were friends and had earned each other\u2019s love and respect over the years. So, when the jokes are said, everyone knows it is not coming from a place of hate. That element is lost when the roasters are hired guns who were just skilled at put down humor. Then, it\u2019s just mean and sad.",

To feel any sort of negative emotion towards someone not attending a funeral, you\u2019ve got a serious issue.\n\nThis is grief we\u2019re talking about here. People deal with it differently on a person by person basis. Giving someone else crap for grieving differently is just stupid. \n\nOn a more personal note, I went to a funeral a few years ago, and I don\u2019t intend on repeating that again. Not something I wish to do ever again. \n\nHow would it make me feel better about grief when I\u2019m just gonna be around a bunch of sad grieving people? Negative surroundings cause negative emotions. I don\u2019t want to be a part of that. Let me grieve on my own terms alone from anyone else. \n\nWhen either of my parents die, I\u2019m not gonna be around for their funeral nor would I be involved in any sort of planning minus finances (I have no issue in helping pay for services, I just wouldn\u2019t come). \n\nIf my siblings die while I\u2019m still alive on this earth, same deal. \n\nFamily members, friends, colleagues, acquaintances, bosses, you name it, not going. Absolutely nothing personal with anyone, I\u2019m just not gonna be there. \n\nOh, and before you comment \u201coh don\u2019t expect people to come to your funeral\u201d, I don\u2019t want one. I\u2019d gladly pay somebody prior to my death to quietly bury me with no services. No vigils, no reception, no nothing.\n\n**Edit**: because I\u2019m tired of typing this:\n\nI am willing to put in any effort necessary to support the family in non funeral related ways. That could be anything; making meals, taking them out of the house to do something, keeping them company, etc etc etc. I\u2019m willing to go through all of the hoops. I just don\u2019t want to be there at the funeral. \n\nI fail to see how not attending putting in this kind of effort would be an issue. ",

Even just a few years old, the menu starts to become slow and streaming services don't work as well (i.e. buffering).  With a firestick on a dumb TV, if the firestick starts to act up, you can replace it for another $55.  When a smart TV starts to act up, you have to spend another $700+ (and that is usually for the lower end model).  Sure there are short term fixes you can do but they all last about a week (if that) before the TV starts acting up again.",

When asked why they love dogs so much, some people tout that dogs will love you unconditionally, don\u2019t care about who you are or how much money you have, and will be there for you during your hardest times.\n\nThe thing is that dogs don\u2019t have a choice whether to be there for you or not. They are animals that live in your home and depend on you for all of their basic needs. They have no concept of money or morals, if you treat them well they will probably love you. \n\nA relationship with a dog is a beautiful thing but in no way is it more important than a relationship with other people. The thing about unconditional love is that the dog will love you even if you are a crappy person. In contrast, a person that sees your flaws and your issues and knows you inside and out, and still chooses to love you is the most beautiful thing in the world. Unconditional love between two people is probably not a healthy thing. If your best friend does crappy things and treats you poorly, you can and should stop loving and supporting that person.\n\nLet\u2019s stop treating dogs as if they\u2019re perfect little angels that are here to fulfill our emotional needs. Remember that they\u2019re animals; treat them as such and seek out meaningful connections with real people.\n\nTLDR: dogs and other animals are great but are in no way morally superior to people for loving you unconditionally. \n\nAlso, I\u2019m not talking about service animals or ESA either.. just purely pet dogs.",

Even with this in mind, my opinion still remains that I have little interest in viewing/purchasing art that looks like photographs. ",

        "text": "Migraine doesn't mean 'bad headache'.  It's a totally different thing. It's a wave of electrical activity that spreads across the brain that causes a whole host of weird symptoms. It has been often described as a 'neural cascade'.  One of those symptoms commonly is headaches, but also blindness, visual hallucinations, intense nausea or nausea-less projectile vomiting, sensitivity to light, aphasia, loss of coordination.  In fact, you can have a migraine and feel NO pain. It's just a very common symptom.  I happen to be a once-in-a-while migraine sufferer who only feels pain maybe a third of the time. I mostly have an ocular aura so intense that I can't see at all, and will projectile vomit. Only some of the time I'll have head pain that gets worse with head movement, but I always go blind and vomit.\n\nMigraine doesn't mean 'strong headache'.  It's a completely different condition that happens to INCLUDE a very strong headache.  It annoys me very much that people say that's giving me a migraine' or 'you're giving me a migraine' because a headache that happens to be strong is not a migraine.  It's a specific thing that often contain a headache that is strong.\n\nIt's like hearing a loud noise which causes your ears to ring and saying you have an ear infection because it hurts.\n\n**edit: Probably about 10% of you are reading this wrong.  Let me make some things much clearer. Here's what I'm NOT saying:**\n\nMigraines are just bad headaches.\n\nIf you have a bad headache, you are not having a migraine.\n\nMigraines only present in one precise way (not sure how people [keep reading this one wrong](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/1884d1g/most_people_use_the_word_migraine_wrong/kbj8b2v/) )\n\n------\n\nIt is completely bizarre to me that people can't differentiate between 'A doesn't automatically mean B' from 'A means not B' or get completely opposite meaning from my post. Slow down, read more carefully. If you're a migraine sufferer and are coming away from this post angry, you most likely read it wrong.",

There's no curiosity among the readers and their advice is always to go nuclear.\r  \n\r  \nI've already picked up on some ways writers will lie to the reader to fool them to be on their side. For example no one ever \"Snoops\". In their stories it's always the most thin story ever like \"We went to a concert in 2013 and I wanted to check the date so I went through his emails\" or \"I was looking for a photo of my dog so I read his DMs\".\r  \n\r  \nI've actually seen people say \"I was feeling insecure so I snooped\" and they get lit up by Redditors so naturally people lie. There's also no taking the story with a grain of salt or a bit of \"I'd like to hear his/her side of the story because this doesn't make sense\"\r  \n\r  \nAlso the \"get therapy\" advice is nauseating. Therapy isn't some magic bullet that makes everything better or \"fixes\" you. It's something to help you develop coping mechanisms. Not everyone needs therapy for every time they stub their toe.

Everyone is telling everyone to go into IT, learn to code. Computer Science became one of the most sought after degrees. \n\nNow come 2024. Everyone and their dog knows how to code. Everyone's cousin is in compsci, there's a massive layoff in tech and everything is getting outsourced to India to South America where code is code, it doesn't care what country it's from. \n\nToday, the same thing that happened to IT in the 2010s is happening to trades. Everyone and their aunt is telling youngster to go into trades because \"it pays a lot of money\". Because \"there's a shortage\". Once again we see the same long waitlist in school, in apprenticeships and the shortage for competent workmen. \n\nWhat that means is in 10-15 years, we are once again going to see the same thing that happened to IT happen to trades. We are gonna have way too many tradesmen and not enough jobs. \n\nWhen that happens the trades apocalypse will come. \n\nTo go even further, the rise of mechatronics and large scale prefab will reduce the labour requirement for a lot of work in the future. They don't need to create a robot that can build it in the field when they can create a robot that can build most of the components in a factory and have a few installer just assemble it like legoes. Big slash in labour cost. \n\nYes we will always still need tradesmen but the 6 figure tradesman is an anomaly, not the norm.

If you cannot do the work that needs to be done within that time, it's an indication of either your manager (or management chain of command/stakeholders) not being able to make decisions on what's most important, or even making a reasonable planning/promises in the first place.\n\nWhy \"you\" as well? Because if you let it happen you're part of the problem and not the solution.\n\nWorking overtime on a regular basis is not sustainable. Working overtime on a regular basis is not a show of commitment. Working overtime on a regular basis is not a good reason for a raise, rather the opposite.",

Maybe unnecessarily high sugar in soda is mainly a US thing, but I'd much rather have an Italian soda or a sparkling water with orange or lemon juice squeezed in than anything from American Fanta for instance.  Colas and Root Beers are the only sodas in my opinion where the sugar content makes sense.\n\nAnother thing is the high amount of added sugar in juices and juice drinks.  It's almost all added sugar unless you get pure Grape or pure Orange juice which is extremely expensive now.  And if you order one of the flavored lemonade options at restaurants, it's usually so sweet it's practically undrinkable.  Just stopped at Charlie's Cheesesteaks (which is a cheese steak chain in US malls) and was appalled by how sickeningly sweet their blueberry lemonade was.  Most lemonades at chain restaurants are ridiculously sweet, but this was beyond the pale.  I couldn't even finish it.\n\n",

        "text": "There seems to be 0 discipline from schools for legitimately dangerous students.\n\nStudents who get into fights often or assault teachers at any point have no place in the general population of students trying to actually learn. Back in the day, the school would inform the parents and the parents would handle it knowing if they didn't their child would get expelled and that would be a pain to deal with on top of the embarrassment. Now most parents have 0 desire to control or raise their children and let them run rampant expecting the school to deal with them because there is no consequences for the parent.\n\nYou can provide all the resources and support you want but by the time a child has hit 16-17 years old they need to be able to be a civilized person and not an animal or phone zombie in the classroom. \"No child left behind\" should also apply to the children who show up on time and ready to learn everyday but have to deal with teacher shortages and general educational decline while the school system tries to accommodate these students who have no desire to learn or do well and only show up because they're legally required to. \n\nIn addition to this, students should be allowed to flunk out of school. These days it's almost impossible not wind up with a high school diploma. Graduation should be an accomplishment, not a expectation. It should represent 4 years of hard work and learning, not simply showing up most days. By dumbing down the curriculums and extending endless grace periods and make ups to students who sit on tik tok all day and never do their home work, you help no one.\n\nIt's important to give support to students who have learning difficulties or other problems out of their control, but not students with attitude / behavioral problems. They need to learn that the world isn't accommodating to the unmotivated, rude, and lazy, and maybe they'd become more motivated if they knew they could actually fail. ",

Normal was taking the time to talk to their neighbors. Normal was slowly learning new skills. Normal was paying only what you could afford. Normal was being happy with what you had. But back then, normal was socially unsexy and people wanted to move on from you.\n\nFast forward to today and now people are seeing how much fucking work it took to be \"normal\". It's the normals who have a house, a family, or achieved whatever their dreams were. And guess what? They are loving life right now. Normal was winning the long game.",

Obviously we chatted for like half an hour, but after that it naturally became silent. I like being a passenger in a car, I like looking out the window and daydreaming. One of my friends on the other hand was having none of it. He constantly had to say something every 10 seconds like \"oh, look at the colour of that car \", \"wow, look at those gas prices, they really are high these days\" or \"the weather today is really nice, although it could be a bit warmer\". Sometimes he even said \"wow haha I'm the only one trying to break the silence\". To me this was really annoying. As I said, I like being lost in my own thoughts, which doesn't mean that I don't like talking to people. But you obviously can't talk through a 3 hour car ride. I felt like his comments not only annoyed the living hell out of me, but also made the trip so much more annoying. Please, if you are one of those people that are uncomfortable when everyone is silent, bring a book with yourself, or find something else you can do that takes your mind off of it. Some of us enjoy silence and are annoyed by your attempt to constantly try to break it.\n\nEdit: I feel like I have to emphasise this one more time. It is NOT \"having a conversation\" that I have a problem with. If we have something to talk about, I'll gladly speak with my friends. It doesn't even have to be something interesting. Sometimes we joke around, without any real meaning or depth to something and that is fun as hell. But sometimes people just sit in silence. And even then, you can talk to them. If you have something on your mind, or you want to spark a conversation about something talk to me, I'm all ears. But if you talk to me SOLELY just to avoid silence, you are going to annoy me.

        "text": "Obviously every family is different. But\n Everyone always talks about how the youngest children are the lucky ones. But in reality most of the time the youngest children have it the worst. Usually the other kids grow out of playing child games. Playing make believe or dolls is boring now. So its similar as the only child who doesn't have a play friend except the child is rejected instead. The parents and other adults get bored of being parents or family members have already been there done that for important milestones and events. and a lot of times the youngest gets the worst parts of their parents marriage. Also the oldest children usually get more help as they are older because once the youngest is finally 18 they feel like they are finally done with dealing with children.\n\nThe older children have a sort of jealousy that the youngest gets to do things that they could have never done but most of the time it's just because parents don't feel like parenting. They are tired its easier and faster if the parent just does it. Or they just don't feel like going through the effort if actually teaching them what to do so they just do it for them. And then once they are adults they just expect them to do it on their own. And then compare them to the older children.\n\n\n\nEdit: I think there definitely are struggles for everyone. Not trying to discredit anyones struggles. Also there is no way that every family will have the same experience. I just always see people being jealous of their youngest siblings and talking about how much harder their lives are because of them. And nobody seems to talk about what it's like being the youngest. It's just what it seems to be in my experience and other people I know experience.",

        "text": "**TL;DR:** When the fast passes are so expensive that most guests don\u2019t buy them, the experience is better for everyone. Fast pass users wait less (and generally have less restrictions) while regular lines move more consistently.\n\nWith less people skipping the line since it\u2019s more expensive, the standard lines move faster as more people from the standard line are able to ride. And if you do pay for a pass, you wait less in the fast pass line. The park may even be able to offer greater access to fast pass users since there are fewer of them.\n\nI frequently go to parks from both Disney and Universal, both with and without the skip the line option, and have noticed a stark contrast between Disney\u2019s and Universal\u2019s line management. \n\nGenie+ at Disney is much more affordable ($20 to $35 per person per day), and thus, a lot of people actually buy it. Genie+ lines often get backed up and take 20-30 minutes at the popular rides, even though you have to make a reservation on the app for each ride you use Genie+ on. Meanwhile, the standby lines move at a crawl and frequently stop completely for 5-10 minutes just so they can let more Genie+ users through.\n\nExpress at Universal is more expensive ($80 to $300 per person per day) and it\u2019s not something that most guests buy. You almost never see Express waits over 15 minutes, and that\u2019s with them allowing Express users to just walk into the rides (no reservations needed). The standby lines also move at a much more steady and consistent pace, and almost never have to slow down since the Express lane is backed up.\n\nMaking fast passes more expensive can allow parks to still bring in extra revenue while providing a greater value for those that buy into the system and a better experience for everyone.\n\nEdited to add: **Ideally, I\u2019d prefer that paid \u201cskip the line\u201d services not exist at all,** and instead have either a free virtual queue system (like the old Disney FastPass) and/or just regular lines (as well as disability access services for those that need it). It\u2019s just that since parks found this as a profit opportunity, and they likely won\u2019t stop selling these, the next best thing is to make it expensive, rather than the affordable version like Disney\u2019s Genie+.",

        "text": "Something that irks my soul is how there are cheap housing communities for 55+ individuals in the range of 100-180k, but the cheapest starter homes for those of us 18-30 are in the realm of 280k+. I personally think its a waste of space because in many cases if someone were to pass away and leave the home to their children, they are typically forced to sell the house unless the HOA of the community isnt dead set on keeping all people under 55 out. Not to mention the plethora of homes that would become accessible on the market, could drastically cut home values which would lower overall costs. There's atleast 8 of these communities within 10 miles of my general area. \n\nEDIT: When i said 280k as lowest, thats a 600sqft shed on a small plot of land. 350k-400k will get you a new development home and all of the already existing homes can basically start at 450k and up. Average home price in my area is half a million.\n\nAlso, im speaking strictly on homes. Condos and apartments would be ideally the best solution for 55+ housing, while cheap double wides and manufactured homes would be ideal as starter homes for young families.",

You could turn your entire body in the opposite direction and they would step in front of you to continue the conversation. No type of obvious hints work. Even if you say your not in the mood they find a way to trap you in conversation.  Where as introverts already know what it is. They keep conversations short and simple.

Because kids actually color in fractions, they arrange shapes to make plants and animals. When the kids get to secondary school, geometry is just proofs and finding unknown lengths or angles. Of course, students will hate it.\n\nDon't get me wrong, axiom-based geometry is important. Euclid's *Elements* basically created the math we know today, but we can teach it differently:\n\n* Give teachers a sextant and have students determine the height of their house\n* Go to a local church and measure the radius of an arch\n* Carefully guide visually impaired students with cutting circles using a compass\n* Track the moon's position every week and mark it on an astrology chart. Yes, astrology is heretical, but you can't deny it's contribution to modern astronomy. This exercise gives students a good understanding of projecting planetary motion and ground tracks.\n* Model the leg motion of a popular dance\n\nAnd also, please emphasize compass-straightedge construction. I study engineering at an elite university. You'd be surprised how many A-students can't draw an octagon with a compass and straightedge; how many A-students who can't even list all 5 platonic solids.\n\nGeometry literally means measure the earth.

But he actually shows very strong leadership traits:\n\n* While he is the most powerful individual in the Galactic Empire after the emperor, he does not lead from an ivory tower. He gets his hand dirty. A rebel fleet is attacking the Death Star? Not only he is in a fighter with his fellow pilots, he actually shoots down most of the enemy ships himself. He is in there to capture rebel leaders, to fight Obi Wan Kenobi, etc. He could very simply have sent a bunch of grunts, but instead he is in the action.\n* He is humble and does not tolerate arrogance and bullshit. When everyone is bragging how badass the Death Star is, he brings everyone down to earth and remembers how it is insignificant in the grand scheme of things. And he was right.\n* He is resourceful. He doesn't care about hiring bounty hunters, which the empire leadership considers \"scum\". He does what needs to be done to get the job done, and in that case, the job got done.\n* He does not tolerate incompetence among people who were put in a leadership position. When he chokes the generals to death, it is not because of pure villainy. It is because his general's bad decisions put unnecessary risk to empire , like alerting the rebels the Empire is coming to Hoth (which required a ground assault, costing men's lives).\n* He also takes the time to go personally to the guy who is building the new Death Star to warn him \"our boss is pissed,  you'd better go back to schedule\". He is a bro trying to help his buddy before it is too late.\n* On the other hand he promotes individuals who are smart. Like the dude who read a strange signal from the probe droid which might have indicated the rebel base was in Hoth.\n\nIf you are smart and humble, you will do fine by having him to your side while crushing the rebel scum.",

Definitely my fault.\n\nSeriously, it takes nothing to not spoil a movie. You want to talk about a movie, and there is somebody in the room who hasn't seen it?

This isn't an excuse for spoiling the sixth sense though.\n\nEdit 2: I'm starting to think that these types of jokes of \"let us spoil x movie when talking about spoilers\", as many of you are doing, must be something exclusive to Americans or old people, as I have lived in various countries, and never met people doing it in real life.\n\nEdit 3: People here are really exaggerating the difficulties of not spoiling a movie. No, the whole world doesn't have to stop just so one random guy doesn't get spoiled. It is as simple as not having tittles on posts and videos that may spoil media, and not spoiling media on posts that aren't centered around that piece of media.\n\nOf course if you go to r/BreakingBad and get spoiled, that's you fault.\n\nfinal edit: im putting thin on the top of my post as i want to go through some recurrent misunderstandings and arguments of this thread\n\nfirs off, my post isnt about spoilers in general, my post is about how a movie being old changes nothing when talking about spoilers. newer generations are literally born with acces to internet. do we really expect them to have watched every single \"classic\" before the age of 18? You guys really think that is reasonable?\n\nalso, and again, it isnt as hard as you guy are making it to be. we dont have to cancel all conversations of all type of media. it is as simple as when you are on the internet, dont spoil things on the tittles of posts, use spoiler tags when spoiling a movie in a post that isnt centered around it, and thats it.

I disagree so well done!\n\nOn to this topic, I hear and see so many people trying to go out and find a partner specifically to get married. They date for a year and a half, then get engaged and are married within three years of meeting their partner. \nThat is absolutely insane to me. I've been with my wife for eleven years (met at 19) and we've been married for just under a year now. The amount we changed between 19 and 29 was obviously drastic, neither of us are the people we were when we met. We dated, spent time knowing each other, growing with each other, learning how we think and how we interact with each other.\nSo many people get married before they've even spent two holiday seasons with each other. It just feels so drastic to want to combine your life with someone else that quickly. Then five years down the line you don't like each other that much as time has passed, but now you have kids or a house or whatever and you feel stuck. Or you end it and are right back where you were seven years earlier with nothing but lawyer bills to show for it \n Marriage is about spending the rest of your life together, not just having kids cause you want them, or because you think marriage is the next step for you.\n\nIf you're planning to spend the rest of your life with someone, why not take the time before you've signed the contract?\nAnd for the people who get married in their mid 30s or so cause they want to have kids - you can always adopt. You don't need to permanently attach yourself to someone just to have a kid with your eyes or whatever. \n\nIDK just my thoughts.",

I find them consistently more delicious with my gyro than salsa is with my tacos. On top of that, the Pita, as food wrapping, is superior to the tortilla in so many ways. Its is more versatile, you can stuff a pita, you cannot stuff a tortilla. Its thick and hearty, fluffy even.  As good as corn tortillas are, they are prone to breaking, you can only make them so big and they are not fluffy in the slightest.  In fact, the only thing the corner taqueria has over the gyro man is horchata. \n\nGyros > Tacos",

People will often complain about incorrect words, but I think people only complain about words changed in their lifetime. Like can vs may, or irregardless. Can has a definition in most dictionaries as a synonym of may, but many still will say \u201coh you can do this thing, but *may* you do this thing?\u201d Similarly with irregardless having a definition, but many still say it\u2019s not a word. \n\nThis is completely arbitrary. For example, inflammable and flammable both mean the same thing, just like regardless and irregardless, but very few will complain about the former. Why? Because the former has been in usage for a longer period of time. \n\nSomething I hate even more is people who say that the \u201ccorrect\u201d way of speaking a language is the way its original country speaks it, like British english or Spain Spanish. But let\u2019s take this to its logical conclusion. Why stop at modern english? Modern English is a mix of latin, french, old norse, and more. \n\nHow do you think these languages made english? Some guy didn\u2019t just decide to mix all of them and make a new language. People who spoke the languages intermingled with each other and mixed words and phrases, and combined with words\u2019 meaning naturally changing over time, eventually made a new language.\n\n If you truly think that original=correct, either start speaking Proto-Indo-European or admit that you only think the language you happened to grow up with is somehow objectively correct. \n\nTldr: The only true way to determine whether a word\u2019s usage is correct is whether it is understood and whether the intended tone is conveyed. Any other attempt to decide what\u2019s correct is usually just \u201cthis is how I grew up using the language so it\u2019s somehow objectively correct.\u201d ",

I mean, come on\u2014those plastic \"rocks\" are so obvious you might as well leave a sticky note that says, \"Key under here, please don\u2019t rob me!\"\n\nInstead, just use a real rock or something that actually blends into your yard. Got plants? Stick the key in a flowerpot or under a legit stone that doesn\u2019t look like it came out of a Dollar Store spy kit.

Hide the key in a woodpile, under a gutter, or inside some random garden gnome. The goal is to outsmart the thieves, not hand them the key on a plastic platter. Using a real rock or anything that doesn\u2019t scream, \"I\u2019m trying way too hard to hide something!\" will go a lot further.",

That\u2019s a mystery..\n\nBesides, the features iPhones offer are nothing different from what high-end smartphones were offering since like 13 years ago (when all this was getting started). \n\nWhat value have they added to their phones in these 13 years, if any at all?\n\nThis is not even minimalism.. given the complications of the smartphone altogether, it\u2019s just plain lack of features \n\nAnd btw I appreciate Apple a lot for their MacBooks, I have one & I love it, it\u2019s the reason I thought of switching to iPhone and I\u2019m somewhat disappointed.. in all fairness, I believe they need to up their smartphone game drastically (not necessarily with above features but in general)\n\nEDIT: I\u2019m surprised at the dedicated defence you all have presented, idk what it is if not blind brand loyalty. Not a single one of you have been able to present a reasonable argument for why would the manufacturers miss out on the basics. The only reasoning you\u2019ve slapped is \u201cwe don\u2019t even need it, we don\u2019t give a f*ck\u201d, in a bitter tone of course. A lot of you are just too comfortable with the status quo of iPhone experience and are convinced that that\u2019s all you need while simply dismissing the fact that these features and many others would make it easier and more comfortable to use at the end of the day. As far as the  \u201csimplicity of iPhone\u201d argument is concerned, why are you willing to pay such high prices for such a \u201csimple\u201d phone? Tell me how will you ever justify paying so much for a phone that offers anything but just the basics from 10 years ago? No justification needed from sellers, they\u2019re just marketing it brilliantly and you all are too proud to admit that it is actually overpriced phone with limited functionality and that they can & should do much better. But you\u2019re all just too afraid to challenge some invisible status quo. Nevertheless, thanks for engaging and I really appreciate the efforts of you all.",

        "text": "Note: Please just take a few minutes to read through the full thing. A lot of people are commenting without reading the post at all. Sure, the title should have been called, \"It should be socially acceptable to dislike dogs,\" but I can't change that now. I get that the use of the word \"hate\" is hyperbolic.\n\nThe moment anybody seems to mention that they dislike dogs, they get a swarm of angry people calling them a heartless monster. If someone were to say that they hate or dislike cats or something, most likely people would accept that. That's not the same for dogs, however.\n\nI've never liked them ever since I was a young girl, and there's quite a few reasons why I personally strongly dislike dogs. Firstly, I don't like how energetic they tend to be. A dog running up to me, jumping around and placing its paws on me freaks me out and overwhelms me. Secondly, I don't like how loud they can be. Everywhere you go, you seem to always hear nonstop barking. Thirdly, I hate how gross they are. Call me a germaphobe, but I hate the idea of dogs licking me. That grosses me out quite a lot, and not to mention that many dogs smell very bad. And lastly, dogs can be very scary. Of course not all of them, but there are countless stories of people getting seriously injured by their own dog, or an unleashed dog out in public.\n\nPeople's obsession with dogs also very weird. Some people make owning a dog their entire personality, and even put them above humans. They sometimes call their own dog their child, and seem to sometimes forget that it is an animal. It's fine if people love dogs as they would a family member, I have nothing against that, it's just when people start treating it more like a human child rather than a pet when it gets creepy for me. I don't mean that in the sense that people can't think of their pet as their own children. Some people can't have kids, and find that love in a pet instead, which I think is fine. What I mean is people who do things like cook full meals for their dog, or even put their dog higher than their own children. My own mother for example owns a dog. She sleeps in the same bed with the dog, get's it meals at McDonalds, and refuses to leave it home alone at any time. \n\nI'm tired of people seeing me as a heartless monster when I say that I both fear, and really dislike dogs. I should clarify, I'm not trying to demonize people who like these animals. I have no problem if you like dogs or not. And yeah, I can understand situations like a guide dog being very helpful for someone. I really don't mean any disrespect here.\n\nEdit: Okay yall, I gotta clarify some stuff. Firstly, no, I don't harm dogs or ever wish harm upon a dog. People that abuse animals are true monsters. Secondly, a lot of people are upset that I'm using the word, \"hate.\" I do admit that the use of the word could come across as hyperbolic, but I can't really change the title of the post. \n\nI do agree that I mostly have an issue with dog owners who refuse to train their dog, and don't interviene when it gets aggressive or overly excited.\n\nIf you love dogs, that's great. I'm very happy that you can find love and joy in this animal. I'm not mad at dogs for just existing. I just don't like being around them, as it makes me anxious and uncomfortable. Many people have claimed that I must be very unhappy in order to not like dogs, but that's just not true. I love many things, dogs just isn't one of them. I don't think that disliking dogs makes me a bad person, since I wish no harm upon them.\n\nMany people thought I was being rude and disrespectful since I talked about how weird some owners can be. Not all dog owners are bad, just the ones who make it their entire personality, or feel very self-entitled because they own a dog. A few people have also compared me hating dogs to stuff like racism, which I honestly find very ridiculous. And no, I'm not a sociopath because I don't like a certain animal.\n\nI'm not hurting anyone with my opinion. I'm just in general not an animal person, but dogs especially I feel are annoying, and freak me out. I've already recieved a few death threats in my dms, so I can only ask that you people be respectful. I'd be happy to answer any questions, just be kind.\n\nBut, thank you to all the people who are supporting my opinion. It's very nice to know that I'm not alone.\n\n  \nEdit 2: Guys, seriously... I get that you're mad, but threatening to find out my location, rape, and kill me isn't okay.",

        "text": "There are different types of companionship, each with its own qualities. Close friends, a spouse, and best friends all share one expectation: they\u2019re meant to last forever. People who believe this aren\u2019t fools\u2014they\u2019re human beings who care deeply about those they love. But life brings relationships where connection is just a product of circumstance\u2014teachers, co-workers, classmates, or neighbors. When those relationships end, it doesn\u2019t hurt as much because they were never built to last. However, society has normalized emotional distance so thoroughly that many forget that losing meaningful bonds can be deeply painful\u2014and some pain isn\u2019t just normal, it\u2019s inevitable.\n\nIf a marriage ends in divorce, the love wasn\u2019t strong enough to begin with. If your so-called best friends stop talking to you, they were never truly your best friends. And not everyone will find a genuine best friend in every chapter of life, no matter how hard they look. The idea of constantly collecting \"new best friends\" is flawed\u2014by its very nature, a best friend is supposed to be rare. If you go around naming new people as your \"best friend\" every time you meet someone new, then either you\u2019re desperate, or you don\u2019t understand the weight of that role.\n\nIt\u2019s alarming how casual people have become about losing friendships. On places like the internet, I see people brushing off drifting apart as normal, sometimes even justifying it with success: \"I drifted away from friends because they weren\u2019t as successful as me.\" But here\u2019s the irony: the same people boast that they don\u2019t care about money but value the \"friendships they made along the way.\" So, which is it? How can you abandon people for better opportunities and still claim to care about the relationships you built?\n\nIf you truly care about your friends, help them access the same opportunities. That\u2019s why successful people often say, \"I\u2019m taking my day ones with me\"\u2014because they understand that real connections hold more value than status or wealth. But many are caught up in superficial ideas, believing that \"you are who you hang out with,\" as if friendship is some reflection of social status. This mindset is dangerous. It encourages people to treat relationships as disposable and transactional. What\u2019s the use of achieving success if everyone around you only wants something from you? Genuine friendship can\u2019t be replaced by people who only see your value in terms of what you can offer them.\n\nYour best friends may not be as driven or ambitious as you are, but when life gets hard, they\u2019re the ones who will still stand by you, no matter their circumstances. Abandoning them because you\u2019ve \"outgrown\" them isn\u2019t growth\u2014it\u2019s shallow and self-serving. The only valid reason to leave a friendship behind is if it becomes toxic. Walking away from friends just because you\u2019re doing better than them reveals more about your lack of character than their shortcomings.\n\nThere is no good excuse not to stay in touch with a best friend. A text takes seconds. True friends don\u2019t disappear\u2014they make an effort, even if it\u2019s minimal. Marriage or kids are not valid reasons to neglect friendships. You\u2019re not on some distant paradise island, cut off from the world, just because you have a family. Life shifts, yes, but when the excitement of marriage fades and children grow older and pull away, what will you have left if you\u2019ve discarded your friends along the way? Kids won\u2019t always want to hang out with you, and marriages don\u2019t guarantee lifelong fulfillment. Without real friendships, you risk waking up one day with nothing but regret, realizing you traded meaningful companionship for fleeting distractions.\n\nIt\u2019s a dangerous cycle\u2014abandoning old friends in favor of new ones, thinking it\u2019s \"just part of life.\" But friendships built on convenience aren\u2019t friendships at all. When you switch from one \"best friend\" to another, calling it an \"upgrade,\" you\u2019re admitting that the previous friendship wasn\u2019t meant to last. Saying someone was your best friend \"at that time\" just proves that you were never truly committed to the bond from the start\u2014they were only ever a temporary companion, not the real thing.\n\nThis is why I say that best friends and spouses are similar. Both represent the peak of their roles\u2014one the ultimate friend, the other the ultimate romantic partner. Both require deep emotional investment and commitment, and both should not be replaced easily. Constantly restarting these relationships from scratch takes a toll, which is why people who truly understand the value of companionship are intentional about preserving those bonds.\n",

        "text": "*Before anyone says ANYTHING about service dogs, this post is NOT ABOUT SERVICE ANIMALS. I am specifically talking about PETS. And yes, your \"emotional support animal\" is also a pet. I'm not saying that they aren't important to you, but a dog that makes you happy is NOT the same as an allergy alert dog or seeing eye dog (etc) that has gone through tons of specialized training and medical regulation.*\n\nI'm allergic to dogs and cats. Even though I prefer cats and I often actively seek them out despite my allergies, I have to deal with my dog allergies WAY more. Why? Because cat owners don't insist on bringing their cats into spaces designed for human beings. The only time I come into contact with cats is when I willingly enter someone's home where a cat lives, in which case I accept responsibility for exposing myself.  This doesn't happen very often because it's easy to avoid going to a home that I know is full of allergens. \n\nDog owners, on the other hand, bring their dogs where they aren't supposed to be ALL THE TIME. I see dogs at the grocery store, in bookstores, at the mall, in Target, etc. I used to work in a cafe and people would bring their dogs in ALL the time, and they'd be standing right next to where we prepare food and drinks. Before that I worked in a bookstore, and we had a strict no-dog policy so I was allowed to tell people they had to leave their dogs outside. And they'd get MAD. Like they'd actually get angry at me when I said they couldn't bring their germ-covered walking destruction machine into a store full of delicate stacks of paper. \n\nI'm an independent artist and I sell at a lot of craft markets and conventions, and it's insane to me how many people bring their dogs. Now, when it's an outdoor market in a park or something, I totally get that. But I'm talking about indoor markets where there's very little space between the booths. People at these markets are often selling food products or very delicate pieces like glasswork. You've brought in a giant dog who won't stop barking and pulling on its leash. How is that a good idea? And what's craziest to me is that the dogs *clearly don't want to be there.* They're not having a good time in this crowded indoor space where they have to sit still while you browse! They want to be running around at the park or something! Why did you bring them? They hate it here!\n\nIt's not just that people bring their dogs to all of these non-dog spaces. It's how mad they get when you dare to suggest that they maybe leave their dogs at home or stick to places that are explicitly dog-friendly, like pet cafes or the dog park. If you say you're worried that the dogs will make a mess, they insist they won't (and then they often do). If you say you're allergic, they say you should just take allergy pills (anyone who takes those knows how ineffective they can be and how many side effects they have) or that YOU, a human person, should be the one staying home. If you comment about sanitation, they act offended, like you personally insulted their dog. I'm not saying your dog is unsanitary because I hate your dog, it's because dogs love to lick themselves and roll around in dirt and their own shit, which is fine when they're at your house or out at the park, but NOT fine when we're in a place that's preparing food! \n\nDog owners frequently have no regard for people who want to avoid their dogs outside, either. When I see a dog approaching me, I will give it a wide berth. I have very valid reasons for this: I'm allergic, I've been bitten by dogs a bunch of times and I don't want to repeat it, and I just don't like it when dogs start pawing and barking at me. But people act like I'm crazy for not wanting to let their dog touch me. I get told things like \"It's okay, he's friendly!\" or \"He's a sweetheart, he won't bite!\" I don't care. I don't want your animal to touch me, and you should be okay with that. I'm not saying I hate all dogs and want them to die, I'm literally just expressing a personal boundary, and people won't respect it because *their* dog is clearly the exception to my rule, right? \n\nWe don't give any other pets this treatment. For example, I love reptiles. I plan on getting a snake soon. And I know that many people don't like snakes and are even afraid of them. I'm totally fine with that. Can you imagine if I took my snake out while shopping? If I kept it wrapped around my shoulders while I went to Target? If I put it on a leash and let it slither up to people? If I responded to their screams of \"Get it away from me!\" with \"Don't worry, she's not venomous, she's a total sweetheart!\" People would treat me like I was insane. Rightfully so! \n\nEvery time I say something like this I get accused of hating dogs. I DON'T HATE DOGS! I'm just sick and tired of dogs getting all these special privileges that we don't give to any other pets because ANIMALS SHOULDN'T BE GIVEN THOSE PRIVILEGES. I promise you, your dog isn't having fun when you make it wait in line with you at the cafe or sit by your side and bark for ages while you peruse the shelves in a tiny shop. If you want to spend time outside the home with your dog, there are so many dog friendly spaces. Leave your dog at home while you grab coffee to go and then go hang out in the park or something. \n\nWhen you get a pet, you are making the decision to be around an animal. Animals are messy, they might not respect your personal space, they're often loud, and sometimes they can hurt you (did you know that roughly 4.5 MILLION PEOPLE in the united states are attacked by dogs PER YEAR?). All of this is uncomfortable, and when you adopt a pet, you're saying okay to all of that. You're making the decision that all of that discomfort is worth it for you. And that's great! But you do NOT get to make that decision for other people who haven't agreed to all of that. This is how it should work for ALL pets. We don't force people to be around any other animal that they haven't agreed to be around but for some reason it's socially acceptable to force your dog on everyone around you. I don't hate dogs, I don't want to get rid of dogs, I don't want to make dogs illegal to own, I LITERALLY JUST want to hold dogs to the SAME STANDARD that we hold ALL OTHER PETS TO! \n\nAnd lastly I'd like to just remind people that dog allergies aren't rare. Roughly 20% of the population has them. Many of those people (including some of my family members) have allergies so severe they could have to go to the ER if exposed for too long, or have combination allergies and asthma, which can be extremely serious. Allergy pills don't always work well and often have very heavy side effects, and if you live in America, they can also get very expensive to stay stocked up on. And getting allergy shots is 1. A VERY lengthy process (like, several years), 2. A very unpleasant process, 3. Very expensive (if you live in the US), and 4. DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK. I've looked into doing it for my cat allergies and it is anything but a simple solution. So maybe consider all of these things before you come into my comments suggesting that 20% of the population \"just take benadryl\" or \"just take allergy shots\" instead of dog owners leaving their dogs at home when they go to fucking Starbucks.

There's also shows like SpongeBob, which brought more adult humor into cartoons.\n\nIt's not that 90s shows aren't good. I really like rocco, Rugrats, Arthur. They're really funny and have this great slice of life element. However, they just feel less in depth when it comes to an overarching narrative. I love shows that have deep narratives. Modern shows like Arcane on Netflix come to mind. Deeper character development with adventure and escalating conflict is just really compelling. \n\nYou can get good character development with these episodic shows, but it's not the same if there isn't an overarching plot. It's way more satisfying when their character development is tied to a larger story. You just don't get that in 90s shows.\n\nAlso, I'm making this post as an experiment. The mods on this sub will delete anything that isn't something they agree with or they can relate to, so I chose something they probably wouldn't delete. Feel free to express your grievances with them below.\n\nThere are some shows that are the exception. Sailor moon came out in the 90s and it's awesome. Early Pokemon also came out in the 90s and both the Kanto and the Jotoh seasons are great. \n\nThe big one, which I mentioned above, just beats almost all other shows. Avatar the last Airbender is truly a god tier show. It blends that episodic feel from shows in the 90s with a gripping and epic story. Characters grow in amazing ways due to plot elements. You just don't get that with a lot of these plot-less shows.\n\nThere's a generational element to it too. I was born in '97, so I would feel differently if I was born earlier. Nostalgic can cloud my judgement, but I just think many of the shows and movies I like today are mostly due to what I prefer. I like big, epic storys AND excellent characters.

Also if someone was to show gratitude I would want to know it\u2019s sincere and I think when people are socially obligated to show gratitude it takes away from real gratitude.

You feel a sense of community with others who like the teams you like, form [hopefully] friendly rivalries with people who like other teams, follow the careers of people with compelling stories. It's fun and it's culture, I can recognize that as someone who never really was into things like soccer/American Football or whatever. This isn't a \"sportsball bad\" or even a \"sports fans bad\" post. Seeing a crowd of people all losing their minds over an insane play or a major upset is a beautiful thing (until someone gets assaulted or breaks something, but there are bad individuals in any group. Thats a person thing, not a sports fan thing).\n\nOrganized games as entertainment has always been about seeing people really good at a thing doing that thing really well, perhaps even better than all the other people they're competing with. Some have a focus on teamplay and strategy, but some are just feats for an individual to do as best they can.\n\nWhat seems to be unpopular is that I think the bar for being a \"real sport\" is too...high? I can't even call it high because there's no consistency beyond \"vibe.\" It isn't an age thing, Chess has been around forever and falls into the \"not a real sport\" category for these people. It isn't a raw physicality thing, Golf, Bowling, Billiards and all its variants (i.e. snooker), Darts, some people call goddamn Beer Pong a sport, all comprise of standing still while doing a thing (most of golf is spent sitting down riding between holes). If you think that Billiards is a sport but something like [whatever esport] isn't, I'd legitimately like to hear from someone what about Billiards is more physically demanding than the coordination required to play a competitive video game at a professional level. The muscle groups that are being tested are pretty much identical, especially if you're comparing shooting pool to using a mouse/keyboard. Unless it's really not about physicality? In which case...it's really just a vibe thing.\n\nWhen talking to people about what's considered a sport, the argument they give is usually \"no one talking in good faith would call esports or chess a real sport, they're just being pedantic if they do.\" It's seen as the null hypothesis, that \"The Big Ones\" are the \"real sports\" and the burden of proof is on whoever would argue otherwise. I'd argue that this weird gatekeeping is the more pedantic thing to do, and I don't understand it...UNLESS you get weirdly defensive about \"outsiders\" trying to enjoy \"your culture.\" Seen through the lens of a high schooler dunking on nerds, yeah that totally makes sense why that person would die on that hill.

This is Such an unpopular opinion :)\nFor those of you who lift weights, you might recall this saying \u2014 Control the weight or it controls you. You aren\u2019t MANDATED to wear a helmet or any protection in the gym. It is your responsibility to know what you need for the weights you\u2019d lift. \n\nI am not talking about doing bike stunts.

If you are older or too young, it is YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to keep yourself safe. Just coz you can\u2019t make good choices for yourself doesn\u2019t mean the rest of us should suffer for it.]\n\nThat you are biking already means you\u2019re open to getting injured. Biking speeds generally go up to 15 mph. It\u2019s remarkably slow for you that you can easily shield your delicate organs if you encounter a static obstacle. \n\nQuick google search says statistically only 1 cyclist in 55000 die in the US while 73% of all cyclist deaths in Canada involved a motor vehicle. There is no way you can defend against a car running over you by wearing a measly helmet.\n\nHelmets also get intrusive and distract you from the road. The straps can dig into your neck. You cannot wear headphones. You sweat more and can also overheat. They can pull on your hair and many of them don\u2019t even fit properly since they aren\u2019t tailor made for every head\n\nHelmets do more harm than good and shouldn\u2019t be made mandatory in any state or country.

They paid for their ticket just like you did and if you don\u2019t like it you can go somewhere else. And if you want to ask them if you can get in front of them and they say no, that\u2019s completely fair. I can\u2019t stand people always complaining that they got behind a tall person at a concert, as if they can\u2019t literally move. It\u2019s not \u201crude\u201d for a person who happens to be tall get a good spot at a concert and choose to stay there. People are so entitled it\u2019s crazy. It drives me nuts when my boyfriend brings me to a concert and waits in line with me and spends so much effort getting us good spots just for people to constantly ask to get in front of him, and then shove him and invade his space and try to squeeze their way in after we say no. I cannot believe people are actually like this to be honest. ",

        "text": "Let me preface this hot take by admitting that I do struggle with time blindness, so being punctual has always been a challenge for me. And even with this, I do make it a point to be mostly on time for work & important commitments (like a funeral or wedding or flights, etc). \n\nThat being said...\n\nTime is a social construct & I think the people who focus intently on being on time or needing to be early are stressing themselves out unnecessarily. More often than not, the show, party, or event goes on & if you miss the beginning, the worse that happens is short term disappointment from missing out. These days we can look up a synopsis or video online of the thing. Or go on social media to see what might have happened. Social engagements, to me, rarely warrant needing to be on time for. If it's a dinner party, I'm not offended if people start eating without me. I'll get what's there when I get there. If it's meeting up for drinks & I'm waiting for someone, I people watch or get myself something while I wait & it's no big deal to me. I've noticed a lot of people think it's disrespectful to be late, but I'm sorry to say I don't see it like that? If you're already in a social setting waiting for someone, what's wrong with just...being there & waiting? And if you have a set time you need to leave, then just stay til you can & go when you need to. How is it disrespectful to your time when you already planned to be somewhere at that time anyway? \n\nAs far as being punctual for work, yes it's professional to be on time for your shift. But even then, how many jobs *truly* have detrimental consequences if someone is late? I'm sure there's roles in the medical or industrial fields where being on time *is* a matter of life or death & those instances should be taken seriously. But again, more often than not, the work does go on, customers still get served or what have you. I especially get irate at this idea that being late means someone doesn't care or is irresponsible. That's a very narrow viewpoint. Sometimes people just have a hard time getting out the door or started on the day. I, personally, work my ass off once I do get to my job & I think the actions of a person at work should also be taken into account if they are an employee that struggles with tardiness. \n\nEven something like flights can be fixed if you're late. It may cost more money or a need to change up parts of a trip, but usually that's more an annoying inconvenience than a life changing issue. I suppose if you're trying to get somewhere before someone passes away or something that's different, but again, a usually rare instance.\n\nMy point is is that overall in life, I simply don't believe punctuality is indicative of someone's character or value. I don't think a majority of activities & events humans do in life warrant this societal pressure to always be thinking about \"being on time\". I also think there should be more grace for those of us that do struggle with punctuality. I truly do not care if a friend is late to my party. Or an assistant shows up a little late for work. If anything it may just be a slight annoyance at having to wait. And actually, on that note, I'd just like to say that part of why I am sometimes late for things is because I *don't* want to sit around waiting for the thing to start! I'd rather get there and immediately begin the said activity.\n\nMost of us who struggle with this, we aren't that pressed, so those that do care about punctuality shouldn't stress themselves out around us about it either. My view is that if less of us focused so much on time, we'd probably be *living* more instead of just existing.",

If you talk to a lot of people who went into \"passion\" careers and maybe even landed their \"dream gig\", a common theme among many of them is disillusion; the musician that got the chance to play backup in their favorite band found out most of the members were insufferable assholes or were stuck working for some horrible creep of a manager; the animator who had dreams of becoming the next Hayao Miyazaki finds themselves being worked to death in a sweatshop of an animation studio; and even on the rare occasions that the gig turns out to be as great as imagined, it often consumes your life completely. After having worked briefly in my \"passion\" field (cooking), I can say that many of the worst moments I experienced were in that field. \n\nAs cynical as it may sound, the best thing for most people is to simply find a job that they don't outright **hate**. After I finished my time with Uncle Sam, I started in a field that had nothing to do with my interests. It's not one that I find particularly riveting, but it matches my skills and, more importantly, it lets me have a healthy work- life balance.

When I was younger, I struggled with shyness and low self-esteem, which led many to form incorrect opinions about me. Once they got to know me better, they would often express surprise at how different I was from their initial assumptions. They sometimes believed that my quietness meant I thought I was superior to them, but that was far from the truth. This kind of misunderstanding is common and usually fades away once people take the time to really get to know each other. My advice to everyone is to avoid jumping to conclusions based on appearances. Each person has their own unique personality, and please know that not everyone will behave or react the same way you do. We often make the mistake of assuming that our way of interacting is the only way, which can come off as a bit arrogant if you ask me. Just because someone is not very talkative does not mean they are unfriendly; they might just be feeling out of place or unsure of themselves in a new environment. Instead of pressuring someone to open up by asking why they are quiet, it is better to give them space and time. The more you push them to explain their behavior, the less likely they are to feel comfortable sharing their thoughts with you. Be patient and understanding, just allow them to reveal themselves at their own pace. By doing this, you create a more welcoming atmosphere for them - that is just the way I see it",

It is essential to recognize that the perception of a narrative can vary among many people, particularly between those who are new to a genre and those who have extensive experience with it.  A person may not be well-acquainted with the common tropes and predictable resolutions that often characterize a genre, while a seasoned mystery enthusiast may have encountered many of these elements before. This disparity in familiarity can influence how each reader perceives the unfolding of the story. Consequently, a well-executed narrative should resonate with everyone regardless of their prior exposure to similar themes or plots.Ultimately, a truly captivating story should maintain its appeal upon subsequent readings. If the narrative is crafted with skill and depth, it should provide a rewarding experience each time it is revisited, allowing others to discover new nuances and insights with every engagement. The enduring quality does not lie not solely in the plot twists but in the richness of its characters and the intricacies of its storytelling",

        "text": "I think Hollywood, especially modern movies and TV shows, are trying too hard to be something good (with a few recent exceptions) You can see the effort behind the projects, and it's still there. The entertainment just looks too clean now. It's too perfect to the point where they're so generic, bland, and boringly repetitive to the point where I turn on any show or movie, or go to the movies I can predict what happens next. It's almost too perfect in a sense. More below:\n\nI'm all welcome to whatever next show or movie is the best, but seeing the recent trailers for things and all recent movies and shows, it just follows the same, bland tryhard formula. And don't worry, it's not just the franchises, It's everywhere. Even in new movies, repeating the same action formula, the same drama formula, same comedy spiffs, same horror spiffs. Everywhere! It's horrible!  \nI guess you could say I'm more into the film industry than many people, but even the cameras seem too clean. Too \"8k ultra, clean, no noise.\" The scripts and dialogue are something from an 8th graders fan fiction of some previous story set in an alternate reality.\n\nAnd I'm going to admit, there have been some fun things in theaters (as of recently), but IMO one movie doesn't necessary have to spawn off of another story, such as sequels or reboots, and for the past 4 or so years, almost everything besides indie films and a few exceptions are freakin' sequels, reboots, or spinoffs.  \nYou can analyze the most popular, or decently known franchises and tell that they are \"trying to make new stories\" but they're just the \"stories they've already told, re-imagined/new stories in the same universe.\"\n\nAnd As I'm speaking, they're even considering, and already have sequel-ed/rebooted classic movies for the money in them, nothing else. Not passion, just they're trying too hard.\n\nAt the end of the day, all we want is bada\\*\\* action sequences, some drama/crime stories, or a silly comedy to make us laugh, or even an original horror movie. Now they're trying too hard to make something \"worthwhile\" or \"the next star wars\" etc... you get the point or trying to \"relate to a new audience on the same movie.\" hence all the remakes and sequels and stuff.\n\nI feel at this point all the major studios are worried about is, \"When can X sequel to X franchise be out!\" not, \"What other scripts or ideas do we have to work with besides franchises.\"\n\nEvery time I go on film twitter or other forums its \"We've just announced the Xth installment to X franchise.\" and it's like... nobody cares... that franchise is dead! Leave it alone! - and then they make 2 sequel movies to profit off of a 20 year old movie that was meant to be a one alone movie.\n\nIt's one thing to have an established franchise, its another thing to try too hard to milk it for profits and not to care about the story.",

Sand is better than basically everything alternative I have seen.\n\nPros of sand:\n\nIt's soft and breaks falls, and doesn't have any sharp bits. (You'd *think* a playground not having sharp or hard substrate should be a given, right? Apparently not.)\n\nLiquid messes are mostly self-cleaning.\n\nIt doesn't get soggy in the rain.\n\nIt doesn't make your clothes dirty.\n\nIt's not a choking hazard. (I don't recommend eating *any* playground substrate, but you know kids. At least make it not immediately fatal if they do.)\n\nWhen it inevitably gets tracked out of the playground, it's not harmful to the environment. Just makes the soil a bit drier.\n\nIt's a toy in itself. Every recess I spent in a sand playground as a kid, there was always someone building or digging in the sand.\n\nCons:\n\nIt can be thrown at other kids and hurt their eyes. (But it's far less damaging than some of the newer substrates when thrown!)\n\nIf there's cats in the neighborhood, they might poop in the sandpit.\n\nThere are two other substrates I've seen that are inferior to sand but still acceptable - dirt and solid rubber.\n\nDirt is pretty similar to sand, except that it's dirty, and after a rain it turns to mud. (Which is also a safe, fun play material for kids, but they'll need a bath, preferably before getting back in the car.)\n\nSolid rubber breaks falls and doesn't have choking hazards as long as it's not damaged, and it also has the benefit of not being usable as a weapon at all. But it is harder to clean, and if it does break down, it's harmful to the environment. And it's not a toy in its own right.\n\nAnd then there's the unacceptable substrates - gravel, rubber bits and wood chips.\n\nGravel is hard, sharp, and both a choking hazard and a potentially lethal projectile. It doesn't break falls, in fact it breaks *you* if you fall. (My 2yo recently fell from a swing onto gravel and was gushing blood from her head. She's fine, but if it had been sand she'd have been unhurt.)\n\nRubber bits aren't hard or sharp, but they're choking hazards. And they get readily tracked out of the play area and become environmental pollutants.\n\nWood chips are the *worst*. They're hard, sharp and have splinters! The only pro is that they're biodegradable, so eventually a wood chip playground will become a dirt playground if not regularly maintained. Unfortunately, I think most of the wood chip playgrounds I've seen are being maintained by misguided people who think wood chips are remotely acceptable in a playground.\n\nWhat will they think of next? Glass shards?",

I feel like a lot of people accept things from partners that they would never accept from a friend because they see them as two different things . Technically they are, but they share  a common ground and that\u2019s friendship. \n\nI feel like because society conditions us to believe that we need to find a romantic partner, a lot of people settle for less than a best friend in a life partner. People also have started to look for partnerships in such inorganic ways. For example, the TV show Love Is Blind or the pop the balloon shows on YouTube. When I think of how a friendship sparks, there\u2019s usually some type of organic meeting in the beginning. For example, I made friends in a class I take because we share that interest. Imagine going onto a show like Love Is Blind or pop the balloon to find a friend. It would feel so fake and forced. Obviously there are exceptions but finding genuine people won\u2019t happen more often than not that way.\n\nSince becoming an adult, I have became more intentional about creating meaningful friendships. Because of this I have had less and less friends, over the past six years I\u2019ve only met three solid friends however to me that is more precious than having 10 friends I\u2019m not sure if I can rely on.  My point is finding a good life partner is something that will come to you if you let it, but when you try to force it and it becomes an objective you cannot shake you start to settle for less or become desperate. I personally feel like this contributes to a lot of people ending up in unhappy relationships. \nMaybe if people didn\u2019t so much importance on the idea of finding a lifelong partner and instead placed importance on how they can fulfill their own or create their own happiness, even without a romantic partner, they may find that happy and genuine connections come to them more easily.

        "text": "Ok, I get why that phrase gets such a bad reaction sometimes: Because some people use it inappropriately. When people are justifiably angry about something wrong, and that anger is in proportion, they shouldn't be told to \"calm down\". It shouldn't be used as a way to stop discussion of something you did wrong. But the fact that some people misuse it doesn't mean it shouldn't ever be said by anyone. A lot of common phrases are appropriate in some situations and inappropriate in others. \n\n\n\nLet's say that someone is \"expressing\" anger that is way out of proportion to the situation... Imagine if I asked my wife to get milk on her way home and she forgot, then I absolutely exploded on her with cuss words and insults. I would love to hear the explanation of why she should just \"listen and empathize\" but absolutely not tell me to \"calm down\". Nobody would regard this as anything but me being extremely cruel to her. \n\n\n\nPeople do things like this sometimes, and they should be told to bring it down. Everyone wants outlets to express anger, but it can rise to a level where it is simply a rage problem. People don't deserve to be the target of rage when they've done nothing wrong or something very minor. \n\n\n\nAs an aside, the people I've heard rail against the phrase \"calm down\" are usually the first to tell others - in some words or another - that they need to do exactly that when the other person is angry with them. It's like they want a special privileged status where they can blow up with rage on whoever they want and shouldn't have to be told to stop, but they demand the most kind, gentle treatment for themselves.",

And, unless your manager was cool, you probably got reprimanded for showing a even the slightest hint of a spine.\n\nPeople often attribute this to the corporate mantra that \"the customer is king\" or \"the customer is always right.\" This is definitely true, but there is another reason: many of these same companies also go out of their way to make it so that going into \"Karen Mode\" is the only way to get some problems solved.\n\nA few examples:\n\n1. One of the best known examples is with cable, internet, and telephone companies. For a long time now, it's pretty well established that, as soon as you call their customer service and start threatening to cancel your contract, you get referred to people whose only job is to get you to stay on at almost any cost. Generally, this comes in the form of a lowered monthly rate, free upgrades and the like.\n2. Among content creators, it has become painfully clear in the last few years that, despite their big talk of \"fair and impartial moderation\", platforms like YouTube and Twitch will only get off their asses and do their jobs when creators call them out on social media and unleash a shitstorm of public outrage. And even then, it's still sometimes a bit of a coin toss.\n\nThis naturally doesn't excuse the behavior of the classic Karens we're familiar with, but there are definitely some sectors where the powers that be not only enable this behavior, but also sometimes make it the only way to even get them to do their jobs.",

Originally, Halloween was supposed to be an anthology series - a different spooky story centered around Halloween every movie. But after the first film, Michael Myers was so popular that they kept bringing him back, shifting the franchise away from its original concept.\n\nThis is why Halloween 3 is its own standalone story with a completely different plot and no Michael Myers. A lot of people hated it because they were expecting more Michael, but I think it showed what the franchise could have been and instead is now just wasted potential.\n\nInstead, we got a long series of sequels, reboots, and retcons, with Michael\u2019s story growing more convoluted each time. While Michael is iconic, I feel the series could have just brought so much more to the table than it did. Halloween could have been a much broader exploration of fear and the supernatural around the holiday. They even could have done a spin-off featuring Michael Myers if they wanted to.\n\nTL;DR: Halloween was supposed to be an anthology series, and while Michael Myers is cool, the franchise would\u2019ve been more interesting if each movie told a new Halloween-inspired story.",

There's plenty of music I don't like that I don't listen to but I can acknowledge that it has an audience and it satisfies that audience. The whole 90% of music is bad spiel is so cynical and frankly pretty unrealistic, I think.

I've always looked several years younger than my age and I've always had slim/athletic build and started growing late so by the time I hit my twenties I grew to be 5'7. So as of right now when I've been told I look like I'm in my late teens- sometimes early twenties. My problem isn't really the way I look, it's often the reactions from the people I encounter or them just making up their minds before they can figure out what's going on or sometimes even think I'm lying about being 29 of all ages. It was at its worse up until I started growing facial hair and started bulking up a little.  Cops and even sometimes people would think I am cutting school, when I already finished. People would give me weird looks and ask me my age when I'm already in a place for adults. And don't get me started on the things I encountered, at work back then. The remarks I get \"You look too young to work\", \"you really work here?\", \"How old are you?\" \" how did you get a job working Healthcare at 14?\" Most of that stuff I don't really deal with no more and brush it off when it does occur but it really is irritating. Especially when I'm at work still to this day. Because this all goes back to people making up their damn Minds before they realize what's going on or they just can't read the room. I work as a DSP and a behavioral house for young men with mental and behavioral issues. It's a pretty cool gig but since I look about the clients' ages every now and then someone who hasn't been to the group home will see me doing something a staff member would and will try to stop me like I'm a client or even talk down to me. And when I tell them who I am a few will say\" Are you sure?\" Like why would I lie saying that I work here and I punched in codes only staff members would no to access the required items I need? I understand people make mistakes but this can get frustrating.\n Here I am either trying to do my job or do something else and some random is trying give me some two cents. Now I can take criticism but being talked down to can be irritating. And as for compliments I don't mind them either. It's just annoying when people over exaggerate or try to say that I look like I belong in high school as if it's one. It can be very condescending. This also can be a double standard. You wouldn't like it if somebody said oh you look old or you're fat. So why do people do it people who look young and small?\nI hope people could relate to this and as for the people that can't, I hope they can learn from this.",

        "text": "The term \"nerd\" is often used to label someone who is intelligent, diligent, or focused on their studies. For instance, if someone feels jealous of your academic success or notices how well you manage your assignments, they might refer to you as a nerd. Interestingly, the word can also be used in a more neutral sense to highlight someone's passion or expertise in a specific area, like calling someone a \"science nerd\" or a \"history nerd.\" for example. Being labeled a nerd typically means you don't fit into the popular or athletic groups, but rather, you think for yourself and have unique interests that set you apart. Embracing your nerdy side can actually be a strength. It means you have a different way of seeing the world, picking up on details and insights that others might overlook. This unique perspective can give you a kind of intelligence that isn't just about grades but also about understanding life in a deeper way. You might find that your interests lead you to discover things that others miss, giving you a special kind of street smarts that is valuable in its own right. So, instead of trying to conform to what others expect, celebrate your individuality. Don't waste your energy on trying to fit in or pretending to be someone you're not; that would be a disservice to your true potential. When someone calls you nerdy, take it as a compliment, as long as it is meant in a positive way. Being a nerd is not a bad thing; it means you have the courage to be yourself and pursue what you love, regardless of what others think",

        "text": "So I\u2019ve seen a lot of people use attachment theory because nowadays labels are popular and self-diagnosis is so common. For those that don\u2019t know, it\u2019s the \u201canxious, disorganized, avoidant and secure\u201d types of attachment. \n\nI\u2019ve been to therapy and funnily enough, my therapist also said he dislikes attachment theory and doesn\u2019t use that at all for his patients. Because it doesn\u2019t make sense to generalize excessively and apply broad strokes to things that sometimes do depend on circumstance and many factors.\n\n\nFor example, if you\u2019re falling in love with someone for real and they pull away and start showing less interest because they never really liked you, EVERYBODY is going to feel bad. Everybody is going to feel anxious about that. And the toxic thing is to put it like it\u2019s your problem, when in reality, it\u2019s the relationship that\u2019s the problem. \n\nAttachment styles are toxic because they can pathologize perfectly normal reactions to difficult or unhealthy dynamics. In a situation where someone is genuinely losing interest or becoming distant, feeling hurt or anxious is a natural response, not a sign of an attachment \u201cissue.\u201d Framing it as such risks making someone internalize blame for what might actually be a one-sided or unstable relationship.\n\nWhen attachment styles are overemphasized, they can become a kind of self-blame mechanism, where people try to \u201cfix\u201d themselves to accommodate behavior that isn\u2019t respectful or reciprocal.\n\nIf I may add personal experience, I\u2019ve fallen into this self-blaming BS and also gaslighting in a relationship when all along I just had to cut them off. Bottom line is don\u2019t question what you feel, don\u2019t feel any shame for your love language, and also don\u2019t try to accommodate or question yourself to what others say. It\u2019s a complete fucking waste of time. For the same reason that it\u2019s socially acceptable that nobody owes you anything and that anyone can leave you at any second. Be in a relationship in your own terms. If it doesn\u2019t align with the other person, then cut the relationship for the best of both sides. Real happy relationships work when you don\u2019t question yourself and can be yourself freely and without shame. Real relationships have commitment and dedication. Don\u2019t settle for less. \n\n\nAnd also they\u2019re a waste of time, because if I take myself as an example and analyze other relationships, I perfectly fall into the 4 categories of attachment depending on what specific relationship I think of.\n\n\n",

Regardless of what canon we go with, the whole thing feels useless. If we go off by Lucas's original plan for the sequel trilogy, Darth Maul (Dark side user but not sith), was still alive and would be the next big bad. If we go by Disney canon, Palpatine never actually died and so neither did the sith.\n\nEither way, the prophecy just seems so insignificant. Dark side users still exist. Sure, depending on what you consider canon (GeorgeVerse or Disney), the sith were wiped out but that hardly feels like balancing the force.\n\nIts like if we completely wiped out every Isis member and then celebrated as if every terrorist all over the world was gone. Like sure, you defeated this one group, but it didn't really make much of a dent in the grand scheme.\n\nEven if all dark side users were wiped out by Anakin Skywalker (Until the sequels that is), it would only have lasted a couple decades. I mean imagine a thousand years being, even unintentionally, dedicated to the eventual death of the sith. The suffering of Anakin Skywalker and many other Jedi eventually culminating into the force being balanced only for it to last a couple decades.\n\nIn conclusion, I feel like the chosen one prophecy was pretty useless no matter how you take it, and wanted to see if there was something I didn't understand",

        "text": "I think a good example to make this point is look at the stark differences between the Twister Movie made in the late 90\u2019s and the modern twister movie in 2024. \n\nThe old Twister had a more detailed in depth experience to the characters and we really got to know them and \u201changout\u201d with them throughout the movie. There wasn\u2019t as much exposition dumping and the movie had its \u201cmoments\u201d but most was pretty grounded. Compare this to the modern twisters movie and it\u2019s like most modern movies in the sense that they try too hard for every character to have this popping personality, and trying to make you like them with the abrupt moments of them dumping exposition and attempts at so many one liners for comedic relief. I\u2019m not against films giving us exposition and giving us comedic relief at times but the film also doesn\u2019t have to hold our hand and try to be witty so much at the same time.\n\nAnother thing to note is modern movies look \u201ctoo perfect\u201d. Older films did it better with CGI imo. The newer CGI looks too clean (for a lack of a better way to explain it) and takes me out of the immersion. \n\nI can also use the example of the top gun films. Of course there was unrealistic moments in the first Top Gun film but the modern one was way too much with how unrealistic it was for the sake of Hollywood moments. I know some people are gonna have ZERO issue with this but imo this happens too much with modern movies. \n\nMindless entertainment isn\u2019t inherently bad but I just feel like we are in a movie slump atm that just tries a \u201csafe formula\u201d that\u2019s based off comedic relief one liners, shoving information in our faces because they\u2019re afraid we won\u2019t follow what\u2019s going on, and these ridiculous moments/scenes that try too hard to make us go \u201cwow\u201d.\n\nSide note: you can apply this to a lot of modern video games as well ",

Shape was already sacrificed for a uniform design, at least on Android and iOS, these days all icons are usually round, squares or squircles. \n\nPosition is flexible, I guess most people sort them for muscle memory, but it shouldn't be the primary thing, especially for stuff you use rarely. If we only have design (which have already become simpler during the last decade) and colour left, why sacrifice one of them just cause it looks a tiny bit nicer? So you have to search a little bit longer and stare a little bit more intensely to find your stuff? And that's assuming you still have good eyesight. \n\nOther argument I've seen was \"less distracting, makes you use your phone less\". Stupid IMO. If it makes your life harder, delete the app ffs, don't have the UI fight your worst instincts. Next time we can, in the name of less distraction, just place textboxes only, no, frick the whole GUI, too distracting, command line only, DOS rules. If you have to know a line of commands and write them down on a virtual keyboard to launch Instagram you'll certainly use it a lot less. /s\n\nIn a nutshell, yet another case of \"minimalism gone wrong\".

        "text": "**TLDR:** If you're booking your own vacation, a luxury or even high- end hotel is, in my opinion, largely a waste of money. Unless you plan to spend your entire vacation in your room, there are way better things to splurge on.\n\nI've done a good amount of travelling in the last decade and have stayed in a variety of different places in many different countries. On a few occasions (usually when travelling for work), I've had the chance to stay in some nicer hotels. What became clear to me is that while I certainly appreciated some amenites (nicer bed, bigger bathroom, good breakfast), I've never really found myself wishing I had \"upgraded\". \n\nAt the end of the day, a hotel (or holiday apartment or whatever) is just a place to rest and recharge between your vacation activities. Sure, it can be nice to have a really good breakfast to start the day or visit the hotel restaurant when you don't feel like going out, but even a top- quality buffet or restaurant isn't really worth it. \n\nMost vacation destinations have lots of good local restaurants and bars around them (actual local restaurants, not \"local\" tourist traps) with food and drink that is both significantly better and probably cheaper that what the hotel has to offer. To give an example:\n\nI like to visit a city named D\u00fcsseldorf a lot. It has a vibrant Japanese community and there is a neighborhood there called Little Tokyo. It's chock- full of restaurants and bars (many run and staffed by Japanese people) and there are even some Japanese supermarkets where you can go for a nice \"Conbini Lunch\" (\"Convenience Store\" lunch- trust me, they're actually really good). You can even find a lot of the \"high- end\" amenities like spas in the area- with significantly more reasonable prices than you'd find in your hotel's in- house spa.\n\nUnless you can get it **super** cheap or someone else is paying for it, I find that it's just not worth it to pay what may be 4x or more per night for luxury accomodations. Instead, it's best to look for a hotel that's just *good enough* (clean, things aren't broken, etc.) and instead use the money you save to splurge a little more on things that you wouldn't be able to find at home.",

If you're like a super mega fan you might not really care and just be happy to see your favorite celebrity more which is ok I guess. But for the average person imagine Michael Jackson comes on stage and he doesn't sing, or sits down the entire time, and just watches the audience for 2-3 hours you know how boring that would be.

And I have some issues with that.\n\nAMD is usable on Linux. AMD is used in consoles. But still, they gave up on high-end GPUs due to Nvidia's dominance, and are instead starting to dominate the CPU market. I have an AMD CPU (Ryzen 5 7600x).\n\nIntel had dominance in the CPU department, but due to their GPU / Arc efforts, their CPU quality has been going down recently. \n\nNvidia has total GPU dominance, both in servers' and in gamers' markets. Still, they don't dabble in CPUs. And, they make some high-quality GPUs, even if they are overpriced (my Asus Cerberus 1050Ti 4GB OC still slays in most games). \n\nWe desperately need a new company to make their own CPUs or GPUs. More competition means that the big three have huge threats on their market share. Companies having a race in technological advancements and in pricing is a good thing. Evidence of that is AMD - they are chasing the mid-range market now, which is most gamers. Why? Because mid-range is what most people use.\n\nThey know that they can't compete in the high-end due to Nvidia just having overall better high-end GPUs, and so they compete in mid-range with prices. I am considering getting a more modern AMD GPU solely because of that reason. \n\nAMD is the king of price to performance, while Nvidia is the kind of performance. ",

I\u2019m not here to fight that battle. \n\nEdit: to clarify some things, I didn\u2019t mean to imply in the title that Fall Back = daylight savings time. That was poor phrasing. I actually don\u2019t care at all about the nomenclature of \u201cstandard\u201d time vs \u201cdaylight savings\u201d time and think those labels should be dropped completely. We should just say there is one long day (Fall Back), one short day (Spring Forward), and 363 regular ass days. \n\nFall back is cool first simply because it\u2019s a bigger day than all the others. 25 hours. And why? Because we *can.* We can make ourselves a holiday and the gift for everyone is an extra hour added to our own personal time, what better gift could there be?? (unless you work graveyard, sry) I think this sort of \u201cabundance spirit\u201d is very appropriate for the fall months with their harvest festival heritage. \n\nFurthermore, Fall Back is poignantly balanced by Spring Forward, a more stoic spring holiday where we remember that to receive, we must also be willing to give. \n\nThe idea that we can come together as a group and get on board with having a long and short day is honestly charming to me. You can tell me it\u2019s silly but so is Easter. You can tell me it\u2019s annoying and makes things slightly more complicated for a brief period of time but so does every holiday parade that closes down traffic. You can tell me it disrupts sleep rhythms, but even more so does getting on a plane and crossing multiple times zones, which people do for holidays all the time. \n\nAs far as holidays go, Fall Back and Spring Forward are some of the best we\u2019ve come up with so far imo. They celebrate both the gift (Fall Back) and responsibility (Spring Forward) of the time we have available to us in our lives. We\u2019re just clinging to an outdated and supremely un-fun interpretation of them when we say they only exist to \u201csave daylight\u201d or whatever the original reason was, like that even matters anymore.

After looking into their discography, I realized the variety of songs I looked forward to hearing everyday on the radio as a kid were all by the same people. With that, they became some of my favorite creators of music.\n\nBUT, they seem to be one of those bands the internet just collectively agrees to hate on for whatever reason. The onslaught of them is so prevalent on any musical comment section I read that isn't from the Train YouTube channel. However, I completely disagree in every way. Just by looking at just some of their songs...\n\nDrops of Jupiter is incredibly meaningful and captivating. About how after death, our loved ones will continue to live on amongst the heavens, gloriously transcending the galaxy and beyond. Drive By is a wonderful, catchy, and bittersweet message of remaining hopeful that our romantic relationships will indeed endure the hardships and work out in the end. Hey Soul Sister is a fun little tune of the small things noticed in a soulmate that caused the falling for them in the first place. Shake Up Christmas sets the December mood perfectly of how we may feel stressed and frantic during the holiday season but in the end of the day, spreading joy to others is its main priority. 50 Ways to Say Goodbye is a hilarious and super entertaining breakup chorus needed for when we need to move on from our problematic exes through humor instead of anger. Calling All Angles is a deep reflection about calling on your better self while dealing with the inner struggles we all go through. And Marry Me is simply one of the best songs that can be used for either a proposal or walking down the aisle on the best day of your life.\n\nThe only criticism I can agree with is their occasional choice of unfitting words sprinkled in their otherwise great lyrics (i.e. fried chicken, so gangsta). But Freddie Mercury also randomly dropped \"fried chicken\" in One Vision and I don't see anyone criticizing that. So, I'll keep enjoying my Train and will continue to feel they're incredibly special in the musical field. Peace.",

I love all dogs his size, but small dogs piss me off, specifically ones like, 25 pounds and under. Chihuahuas, toy poodles, Shih Tzu's, Pomeranians, Maltese, Yorkshire Terrier, those kinds of dogs.\n\nI have never once been attacked by a large dog. However, I have been bit by a dog before, and that dog was a chihuahua I was petting. It wasn't too bad, but it still hurt and bled a bit. The owner then proceeded to blame me for making her dog bit me as \"he doesn't do that with other people.\"\n\nAnd that's another reason, the owners. All owners of small dogs that I've met can never just accept that their dogs suck. They don't feel the need to train them, so they run and people and nip people and get away with it. And the owner either fully denies that their dog acts like that, or blame you for doing something to their dog.\n\nGoing back to my dog, he's a very good boy. He's large, about 110 pounds, but he's very well trained, to the point where we often leave him off leash around our house and he won't sprint to the road to try and meet people. He is extremely calm with dogs his size as if they meet on a walk they'll usually just like, bark at each other and move on. But when smaller dogs go near my dog on a walk they try and run at him or attack him, which aggitates him. And of course the owner of the smaller dog blames me when I'm just minding my own business and her dog came up to mine!\n\nFinally, small dogs just make me nervous. Their barking is high pitched and it makes me panic, they never stop trying to jump on me or climb on me, and the owners think I'm weird for wanting their dog off of me.\n\nNow obviously there's acceptions. My cousin has a small like, 3 pound dog, and he's one of the sweetest dogs in the world. But most small dogs genuinely suck and I hate them. ",

If your MC pirate crew is somehow friends with many others, then they aren't really pirates and more like some Mary-Sue fantasy fulfillment. This makes establishing impactful conflict in the story difficult as every faction would realistically be hostile.\n\n**2. Being pirates also makes establishing motivation difficult**\n\nLots of drama comes from a \"saving the world\" plot. It works for other themes as maybe morality would compel the MC to act, but being a pirate means they shouldn't really bother about world-destroying affairs. After all, they are already scrapping by to survive, the town/city/kingdom being destroyed would really not be any more concern of theirs. So what motivation is there to keep the audience invested?\n\n**3. Even if the plot somehow forces a redemption arc, it makes the whole premise rather useless**\n\nMaybe then, it could be a tale of redemption of the pirate crew, but the majority of the storyline would then require them to act out-of-character to what a pirate is being about and it makes the plot predictable, dull and cheesy - something like StarWars Battlefront II's Imperial pilots campaign.\n\nAt that point, you might as well scrap the pirate theme entirely\n\nWhere could pirates work?

If somehow we go through with spending trillions of dollars to establish infrastructure, that doesn\u2019t change the fact that there is nothing there for us.

There was clearly a bond and shared interests that brought you together in the first place so why throw that away just because the romantic part didn\u2019t work out? Sure there's hurt when a relationship ends, but once that pain fades friendship feels like the natural next step to me. Of course this doesn\u2019t apply to toxic or messy breakups, but in general if things ended amicably it seems logical to keep that connection alive. Anyone else feel this way or is it just me?\n\nEdit: looks like there are people that agree and disagree. I know my take is very unpopular but to me i find it immature if u can't even set aside your feelings to maintain a friendship. I find it a green flag if a partner can still be friends with an ex if anything it be weird if my partner isn't even friends with any of their exes. It tells me all their relationship wasn't good",

        "text": "People often misinterpret someone\u2019s reserved nature as being unfriendly or snobbish. When I was younger, I struggled with shyness and low self-esteem, which led many to form incorrect opinions about me. Once they got to know me better, they would often express surprise at how different I was from their initial assumptions. They sometimes believed that my quietness meant I thought I was superior to them, but that was far from the truth. This kind of misunderstanding is common and usually fades away once people take the time to really get to know each other. My advice to everyone is to avoid jumping to conclusions based on appearances. Each person has their own unique personality, and please know that not everyone will behave or react the same way you do. We often make the mistake of assuming that our way of interacting is the only way, which can come off as a bit arrogant if you ask me. Just because someone is not very talkative does not mean they are unfriendly; they might just be feeling out of place or unsure of themselves in a new environment. Instead of pressuring someone to open up by asking why they are quiet, it is better to give them space and time. The more you push them to explain their behavior, the less likely they are to feel comfortable sharing their thoughts with you. Be patient and understanding, just allow them to reveal themselves at their own pace. By doing this, you create a more welcoming atmosphere for them - that is just the way I see it",

It is essential to recognize that the perception of a narrative can vary among many people, particularly between those who are new to a genre and those who have extensive experience with it.  A person may not be well-acquainted with the common tropes and predictable resolutions that often characterize a genre, while a seasoned mystery enthusiast may have encountered many of these elements before. This disparity in familiarity can influence how each reader perceives the unfolding of the story. Consequently, a well-executed narrative should resonate with everyone regardless of their prior exposure to similar themes or plots.Ultimately, a truly captivating story should maintain its appeal upon subsequent readings. If the narrative is crafted with skill and depth, it should provide a rewarding experience each time it is revisited, allowing others to discover new nuances and insights with every engagement.

The entertainment just looks too clean now. It's too perfect to the point where they're so generic, bland, and boringly repetitive to the point where I turn on any show or movie, or go to the movies I can predict what happens next. It's almost too perfect in a sense. More below:\n\nI'm all welcome to whatever next show or movie is the best, but seeing the recent trailers for things and all recent movies and shows, it just follows the same, bland tryhard formula. And don't worry, it's not just the franchises, It's everywhere. Even in new movies, repeating the same action formula, the same drama formula, same comedy spiffs, same horror spiffs. Everywhere! It's horrible!  \nI guess you could say I'm more into the film industry than many people, but even the cameras seem too clean. Too \"8k ultra, clean, no noise.\" The scripts and dialogue are something from an 8th graders fan fiction of some previous story set in an alternate reality.\n\nAnd I'm going to admit, there have been some fun things in theaters (as of recently), but IMO one movie doesn't necessary have to spawn off of another story, such as sequels or reboots, and for the past 4 or so years, almost everything besides indie films and a few exceptions are freakin' sequels, reboots, or spinoffs.  \nYou can analyze the most popular, or decently known franchises and tell that they are \"trying to make new stories\" but they're just the \"stories they've already told, re-imagined/new stories in the same universe.\"\n\nAnd As I'm speaking, they're even considering, and already have sequel-ed/rebooted classic movies for the money in them, nothing else. Not passion, just they're trying too hard.\n\nAt the end of the day, all we want is bada\\*\\* action sequences, some drama/crime stories, or a silly comedy to make us laugh, or even an original horror movie. Now they're trying too hard to make something \"worthwhile\" or \"the next star wars\" etc... you get the point or trying to \"relate to a new audience on the same movie.\" hence all the remakes and sequels and stuff.\n\nI feel at this point all the major studios are worried about is, \"When can X sequel to X franchise be out!\" not, \"What other scripts or ideas do we have to work with besides franchises.\"\n\nEvery time I go on film twitter or other forums its \"We've just announced the Xth installment to X franchise.\" and it's like... nobody cares... that franchise is dead! Leave it alone! - and then they make 2 sequel movies to profit off of a 20 year old movie that was meant to be a one alone movie.\n\nIt's one thing to have an established franchise, its another thing to try too hard to milk it for profits and not to care about the story.",

Sand is better than basically everything alternative I have seen.\n\nPros of sand:\n\nIt's soft and breaks falls, and doesn't have any sharp bits. (You'd *think* a playground not having sharp or hard substrate should be a given, right? Apparently not.)\n\nLiquid messes are mostly self-cleaning.\n\nIt doesn't get soggy in the rain.\n\nIt doesn't make your clothes dirty.\n\nIt's not a choking hazard. (I don't recommend eating *any* playground substrate, but you know kids. At least make it not immediately fatal if they do.)\n\nWhen it inevitably gets tracked out of the playground, it's not harmful to the environment. Just makes the soil a bit drier.\n\nIt's a toy in itself. Every recess I spent in a sand playground as a kid, there was always someone building or digging in the sand.\n\nCons:\n\nIt can be thrown at other kids and hurt their eyes. (But it's far less damaging than some of the newer substrates when thrown!)\n\nIf there's cats in the neighborhood, they might poop in the sandpit.\n\nThere are two other substrates I've seen that are inferior to sand but still acceptable - dirt and solid rubber.\n\nDirt is pretty similar to sand, except that it's dirty, and after a rain it turns to mud. (Which is also a safe, fun play material for kids, but they'll need a bath, preferably before getting back in the car.)\n\nSolid rubber breaks falls and doesn't have choking hazards as long as it's not damaged, and it also has the benefit of not being usable as a weapon at all. But it is harder to clean, and if it does break down, it's harmful to the environment. And it's not a toy in its own right.\n\nAnd then there's the unacceptable substrates - gravel, rubber bits and wood chips.\n\nGravel is hard, sharp, and both a choking hazard and a potentially lethal projectile. It doesn't break falls, in fact it breaks *you* if you fall. (My 2yo recently fell from a swing onto gravel and was gushing blood from her head. She's fine, but if it had been sand she'd have been unhurt.)\n\nRubber bits aren't hard or sharp, but they're choking hazards. And they get readily tracked out of the play area and become environmental pollutants.\n\nWood chips are the *worst*. They're hard, sharp and have splinters! The only pro is that they're biodegradable, so eventually a wood chip playground will become a dirt playground if not regularly maintained. Unfortunately, I think most of the wood chip playgrounds I've seen are being maintained by misguided people who think wood chips are remotely acceptable in a playground.\n\nWhat will they think of next? Glass shards?",

I'm trying to have a discussion but you just throw insults at me! Am I a jester or a clown?\n3. I've noticed some contradictory statements as well. For instance, I just read someone (not naming names) say, 'Humanity doesn't suck, it's just that people suck.' This kind of sentiment complicates the conversation unnecessarily. If humanity is inherently flawed, how do we differentiate the positive from the negative? It\u2019s a slippery slope. Yeah that's what it is.\n\n\n\n\"ooOOohh look at me Im so intellectual and humanity sucks\" -Statements made by many, but by the UTTERLY DERANGED\n\nThere\u2019s a growing trend of anti-human rhetoric that I find deeply troubling and misguided.\n\nYou aren't more intellectual, stoic, or wise for hating humanity as a whole; in fact it makes you worse.\n\n1. **Misanthropy's Effects** Some historical figures have taken their disdain for humanity to dangerous extremes, leading to actions that caused significant harm.\n2. **People love to cite all the bad humanity has done.** Whenever someone cites good things we've brought into this world, they simply say \"UHm uhhh uhhhmm... most humans are bad so my point still stands\"\n3. ***STOP SAYING THAT HUMANS ARE SHIT!***\n4. **Anti-human rhetoric impedes progress.** If we want to be better, how will we be better if we insist we are inherently bad?\n5. **Stop Perpetuating the Cycle of Cynicism.** Cynicism has a way of breeding more cynicism. When people fixate on humanity\u2019s shortcomings, they\u2019re less likely to see opportunities for change and improvement.",

I feel like a lot of people accept things from partners that they would never accept from a friend because they see them as two different things . Technically they are, but they share  a common ground and that\u2019s friendship. \n\nI feel like because society conditions us to believe that we need to find a romantic partner, a lot of people settle for less than a best friend in a life partner. People also have started to look for partnerships in such inorganic ways. For example, the TV show Love Is Blind or the pop the balloon shows on YouTube. When I think of how a friendship sparks, there\u2019s usually some type of organic meeting in the beginning. For example, I made friends in a class I take because we share that interest. Imagine going onto a show like Love Is Blind or pop the balloon to find a friend. It would feel so fake and forced. Obviously there are exceptions but finding genuine people won\u2019t happen more often than not that way.\n\nSince becoming an adult, I have became more intentional about creating meaningful friendships. Because of this I have had less and less friends, over the past six years I\u2019ve only met three solid friends however to me that is more precious than having 10 friends I\u2019m not sure if I can rely on.  My point is finding a good life partner is something that will come to you if you let it, but when you try to force it and it becomes an objective you cannot shake you start to settle for less or become desperate. I personally feel like this contributes to a lot of people ending up in unhappy relationships. \nMaybe if people didn\u2019t so much importance on the idea of finding a lifelong partner and instead placed importance on how they can fulfill their own or create their own happiness, even without a romantic partner, they may find that happy and genuine connections come to them more easily.

This in turn causes the developers to balance the game around them, the 0.001% of the playerbase, often making aspects of the game unusable or unviable for the rest of the playerbase. \n\nThat character/champion/weapon you enjoy? Now it\u2019s crap because in the last tournament, some dude spent hundreds of hours min-maxing and breaking it to win. Just want to enjoy a casual experience? The devs removed skill based matchmaking so these players can keep bullying every casual to make epic moments and post them somewhere. \n\nI don\u2019t have anything against these people personally, but it really sucks seeing how competitive games don\u2019t feel the same after e-sports became popular. I hate having to deal with crap balancing because a tiny minority of players basically control how games are balanced, I find the whole cult of personality around these celebrities disgusting. I don\u2019t want to open a game and see tournaments getting advertised, don\u2019t want to see their faces plastered everywhere as if they are some sort of badasses. \n\nMost of them (specially streamers) exude toxicity that gets spread in the whole community, childish behaviour like saying \u201cdiff\u201d or \u201cez\u201d on voice or chat after a match. I\u2019m trying to have fun, I don\u2019t need to necessarily win or sweat through the game so I don\u2019t see the point of being an ass and boast about your performance after a match. Smurfing also became so bad, they camouflage it as being from bronze to grandmaster or whatever ranking system the game uses. Some games even made it not against the rules. Honestly, I wish e-sports just stopped existing as a whole. ",

If we do end up failing the test however, we usually get 3 more attempts at the MCAS across the entirety of high school, and if you don't pass after 4 attempts, you don't graduate. The thing is, you only need about 40% on the test to score above Not Meeting Expectations from what I have seen with my friends, and you have the entire school day to complete the test. This is easily doable if you have basic math, english, and science skills that are tested on the MCAS, especially considering most of the test is multiple-choice. I feel like if we get rid of state standardized tests like MCAS, then this will make it so that people who don't know basic math or english can graduate, lowering the value of the high school diploma even more than it already has been, and the kids who would have not passed the MCAS even after multiple attempts will graduate, leading them to struggle a lot in the real world due to not having basic reading/writing or math skills.",

        "text": "Ok, I get why that phrase gets such a bad reaction sometimes: Because some people use it inappropriately. When people are justifiably angry about something wrong, and that anger is in proportion, they shouldn't be told to \"calm down\". It shouldn't be used as a way to stop discussion of something you did wrong. But the fact that some people misuse it doesn't mean it shouldn't ever be said by anyone. A lot of common phrases are appropriate in some situations and inappropriate in others. \n\n\n\nLet's say that someone is \"expressing\" anger that is way out of proportion to the situation... Imagine if I asked my wife to get milk on her way home and she forgot, then I absolutely exploded on her with cuss words and insults. I would love to hear the explanation of why she should just \"listen and empathize\" but absolutely not tell me to \"calm down\". Nobody would regard this as anything but me being extremely cruel to her. \n\n\n\nPeople do things like this sometimes, and they should be told to bring it down. Everyone wants outlets to express anger, but it can rise to a level where it is simply a rage problem. People don't deserve to be the target of rage when they've done nothing wrong or something very minor. \n\n\n\nAs an aside, the people I've heard rail against the phrase \"calm down\" are usually the first to tell others - in some words or another - that they need to do exactly that when the other person is angry with them. It's like they want a special privileged status where they can blow up with rage on whoever they want and shouldn't have to be told to stop, but they demand the most kind, gentle treatment for themselves.",

One of the best known examples is with cable, internet, and telephone companies. For a long time now, it's pretty well established that, as soon as you call their customer service and start threatening to cancel your contract, you get referred to people whose only job is to get you to stay on at almost any cost. Generally, this comes in the form of a lowered monthly rate, free upgrades and the like.\n2. Among content creators, it has become painfully clear in the last few years that, despite their big talk of \"fair and impartial moderation\", platforms like YouTube and Twitch will only get off their asses and do their jobs when creators call them out on social media and unleash a shitstorm of public outrage. And even then, it's still sometimes a bit of a coin toss.\n\nThis naturally doesn't excuse the behavior of the classic Karens we're familiar with, but there are definitely some sectors where the powers that be not only enable this behavior, but also sometimes make it the only way to even get them to do their jobs.",

Originally, Halloween was supposed to be an anthology series - a different spooky story centered around Halloween every movie. But after the first film, Michael Myers was so popular that they kept bringing him back, shifting the franchise away from its original concept.\n\nThis is why Halloween 3 is its own standalone story with a completely different plot and no Michael Myers. A lot of people hated it because they were expecting more Michael, but I think it showed what the franchise could have been and instead is now just wasted potential.\n\nInstead, we got a long series of sequels, reboots, and retcons, with Michael\u2019s story growing more convoluted each time. While Michael is iconic, I feel the series could have just brought so much more to the table than it did. Halloween could have been a much broader exploration of fear and the supernatural around the holiday. They even could have done a spin-off featuring Michael Myers if they wanted to.\n\nTL;DR: Halloween was supposed to be an anthology series, and while Michael Myers is cool, the franchise would\u2019ve been more interesting if each movie told a new Halloween-inspired story.",

For one, it\u2019s just more fun and lets you actually get creative whether it\u2019s dressing up in cool costumes, decorating with spooky stuff, or bingeing horror movies. Christmas tends to be all about buying gifts and the stress of family gatherings, which honestly can be exhausting. Studies even show people get more depressed around Christmas because of all the pressure! Halloween just feels more festive in a chill way, with those cozy fall vibes, fun decorations, and way better music. I mean, who doesn\u2019t love spooky tunes over hearing the same Christmas songs on repeat all winter? Halloween just lets you enjoy the season without all the crazy expectations.",

I've always looked several years younger than my age and I've always had slim/athletic build and started growing late so by the time I hit my twenties I grew to be 5'7. So as of right now when I've been told I look like I'm in my late teens- sometimes early twenties. My problem isn't really the way I look, it's often the reactions from the people I encounter or them just making up their minds before they can figure out what's going on or sometimes even think I'm lying about being 29 of all ages. It was at its worse up until I started growing facial hair and started bulking up a little.  Cops and even sometimes people would think I am cutting school, when I already finished. People would give me weird looks and ask me my age when I'm already in a place for adults. And don't get me started on the things I encountered, at work back then. The remarks I get \"You look too young to work\", \"you really work here?\", \"How old are you?\" \" how did you get a job working Healthcare at 14?\" Most of that stuff I don't really deal with no more and brush it off when it does occur but it really is irritating. Especially when I'm at work still to this day. Because this all goes back to people making up their damn Minds before they realize what's going on or they just can't read the room. I work as a DSP and a behavioral house for young men with mental and behavioral issues. It's a pretty cool gig but since I look about the clients' ages every now and then someone who hasn't been to the group home will see me doing something a staff member would and will try to stop me like I'm a client or even talk down to me. And when I tell them who I am a few will say\" Are you sure?\" Like why would I lie saying that I work here and I punched in codes only staff members would no to access the required items I need? I understand people make mistakes but this can get frustrating.\n Here I am either trying to do my job or do something else and some random is trying give me some two cents. Now I can take criticism but being talked down to can be irritating. And as for compliments I don't mind them either. It's just annoying when people over exaggerate or try to say that I look like I belong in high school as if it's one. It can be very condescending. This also can be a double standard. You wouldn't like it if somebody said oh you look old or you're fat. So why do people do it people who look young and small?\nI hope people could relate to this and as for the people that can't, I hope they can learn from this.",

        "text": "The term \"nerd\" is often used to label someone who is intelligent, diligent, or focused on their studies. For instance, if someone feels jealous of your academic success or notices how well you manage your assignments, they might refer to you as a nerd. Interestingly, the word can also be used in a more neutral sense to highlight someone's passion or expertise in a specific area, like calling someone a \"science nerd\" or a \"history nerd.\" for example. Being labeled a nerd typically means you don't fit into the popular or athletic groups, but rather, you think for yourself and have unique interests that set you apart. Embracing your nerdy side can actually be a strength. It means you have a different way of seeing the world, picking up on details and insights that others might overlook. This unique perspective can give you a kind of intelligence that isn't just about grades but also about understanding life in a deeper way. You might find that your interests lead you to discover things that others miss, giving you a special kind of street smarts that is valuable in its own right. So, instead of trying to conform to what others expect, celebrate your individuality. Don't waste your energy on trying to fit in or pretending to be someone you're not; that would be a disservice to your true potential. When someone calls you nerdy, take it as a compliment, as long as it is meant in a positive way. Being a nerd is not a bad thing; it means you have the courage to be yourself and pursue what you love, regardless of what others think",

Icelandic composer P\u00e9tur J\u00f3nsson crafted it using piano and strings, giving it a more classical, cinematic quality. The orchestration added depth and warmth to the piece, blending acoustic textures with electronic undertones to create that lush, dreamy atmosphere.

        "text": "So I\u2019ve seen a lot of people use attachment theory because nowadays labels are popular and self-diagnosis is so common. For those that don\u2019t know, it\u2019s the \u201canxious, disorganized, avoidant and secure\u201d types of attachment. \n\nI\u2019ve been to therapy and funnily enough, my therapist also said he dislikes attachment theory and doesn\u2019t use that at all for his patients. Because it doesn\u2019t make sense to generalize excessively and apply broad strokes to things that sometimes do depend on circumstance and many factors.\n\n\nFor example, if you\u2019re falling in love with someone for real and they pull away and start showing less interest because they never really liked you, EVERYBODY is going to feel bad. Everybody is going to feel anxious about that. And the toxic thing is to put it like it\u2019s your problem, when in reality, it\u2019s the relationship that\u2019s the problem. \n\nAttachment styles are toxic because they can pathologize perfectly normal reactions to difficult or unhealthy dynamics. In a situation where someone is genuinely losing interest or becoming distant, feeling hurt or anxious is a natural response, not a sign of an attachment \u201cissue.\u201d Framing it as such risks making someone internalize blame for what might actually be a one-sided or unstable relationship.\n\nWhen attachment styles are overemphasized, they can become a kind of self-blame mechanism, where people try to \u201cfix\u201d themselves to accommodate behavior that isn\u2019t respectful or reciprocal.\n\nIf I may add personal experience, I\u2019ve fallen into this self-blaming BS and also gaslighting in a relationship when all along I just had to cut them off. Bottom line is don\u2019t question what you feel, don\u2019t feel any shame for your love language, and also don\u2019t try to accommodate or question yourself to what others say. It\u2019s a complete fucking waste of time. For the same reason that it\u2019s socially acceptable that nobody owes you anything and that anyone can leave you at any second. Be in a relationship in your own terms. If it doesn\u2019t align with the other person, then cut the relationship for the best of both sides. Real happy relationships work when you don\u2019t question yourself and can be yourself freely and without shame. Real relationships have commitment and dedication. Don\u2019t settle for less. \n\n\nAnd also they\u2019re a waste of time, because if I take myself as an example and analyze other relationships, I perfectly fall into the 4 categories of attachment depending on what specific relationship I think of.\n\n\n",

Regardless of what canon we go with, the whole thing feels useless. If we go off by Lucas's original plan for the sequel trilogy, Darth Maul (Dark side user but not sith), was still alive and would be the next big bad. If we go by Disney canon, Palpatine never actually died and so neither did the sith.\n\nEither way, the prophecy just seems so insignificant. Dark side users still exist. Sure, depending on what you consider canon (GeorgeVerse or Disney), the sith were wiped out but that hardly feels like balancing the force.\n\nIts like if we completely wiped out every Isis member and then celebrated as if every terrorist all over the world was gone. Like sure, you defeated this one group, but it didn't really make much of a dent in the grand scheme.\n\nEven if all dark side users were wiped out by Anakin Skywalker (Until the sequels that is), it would only have lasted a couple decades. I mean imagine a thousand years being, even unintentionally, dedicated to the eventual death of the sith. The suffering of Anakin Skywalker and many other Jedi eventually culminating into the force being balanced only for it to last a couple decades.\n\nIn conclusion, I feel like the chosen one prophecy was pretty useless no matter how you take it, and wanted to see if there was something I didn't understand",

        "text": "I think a good example to make this point is look at the stark differences between the Twister Movie made in the late 90\u2019s and the modern twister movie in 2024. \n\nThe old Twister had a more detailed in depth experience to the characters and we really got to know them and \u201changout\u201d with them throughout the movie. There wasn\u2019t as much exposition dumping and the movie had its \u201cmoments\u201d but most was pretty grounded. Compare this to the modern twisters movie and it\u2019s like most modern movies in the sense that they try too hard for every character to have this popping personality, and trying to make you like them with the abrupt moments of them dumping exposition and attempts at so many one liners for comedic relief. I\u2019m not against films giving us exposition and giving us comedic relief at times but the film also doesn\u2019t have to hold our hand and try to be witty so much at the same time.\n\nAnother thing to note is modern movies look \u201ctoo perfect\u201d. Older films did it better with CGI imo. The newer CGI looks too clean (for a lack of a better way to explain it) and takes me out of the immersion. \n\nI can also use the example of the top gun films. Of course there was unrealistic moments in the first Top Gun film but the modern one was way too much with how unrealistic it was for the sake of Hollywood moments. I know some people are gonna have ZERO issue with this but imo this happens too much with modern movies. \n\nMindless entertainment isn\u2019t inherently bad but I just feel like we are in a movie slump atm that just tries a \u201csafe formula\u201d that\u2019s based off comedic relief one liners, shoving information in our faces because they\u2019re afraid we won\u2019t follow what\u2019s going on, and these ridiculous moments/scenes that try too hard to make us go \u201cwow\u201d.\n\nSide note: you can apply this to a lot of modern video games as well ",

Shape was already sacrificed for a uniform design, at least on Android and iOS, these days all icons are usually round, squares or squircles. \n\nPosition is flexible, I guess most people sort them for muscle memory, but it shouldn't be the primary thing, especially for stuff you use rarely. If we only have design (which have already become simpler during the last decade) and colour left, why sacrifice one of them just cause it looks a tiny bit nicer? So you have to search a little bit longer and stare a little bit more intensely to find your stuff? And that's assuming you still have good eyesight. \n\nOther argument I've seen was \"less distracting, makes you use your phone less\". Stupid IMO.

Sure, it can be nice to have a really good breakfast to start the day or visit the hotel restaurant when you don't feel like going out, but even a top- quality buffet or restaurant isn't really worth it. \n\nMost vacation destinations have lots of good local restaurants and bars around them (actual local restaurants, not \"local\" tourist traps) with food and drink that is both significantly better and probably cheaper that what the hotel has to offer. To give an example:\n\nI like to visit a city named D\u00fcsseldorf a lot. It has a vibrant Japanese community and there is a neighborhood there called Little Tokyo. It's chock- full of restaurants and bars (many run and staffed by Japanese people) and there are even some Japanese supermarkets where you can go for a nice \"Conbini Lunch\" (\"Convenience Store\" lunch- trust me, they're actually really good). You can even find a lot of the \"high- end\" amenities like spas in the area- with significantly more reasonable prices than you'd find in your hotel's in- house spa.\n\nUnless you can get it **super** cheap or someone else is paying for it, I find that it's just not worth it to pay what may be 4x or more per night for luxury accomodations. Instead, it's best to look for a hotel that's just *good enough* (clean, things aren't broken, etc.) and instead use the money you save to splurge a little more on things that you wouldn't be able to find at home.",

A lot of listening parties are messy there is no choreography or showmanship. A lot of times it's the singer/artist and their buddies hopping on the stage and dancing or whatever and people are just praising them for just releasing the music. Back in the day artists had to actually perform or be talented or impressive. Work to capture the audience's attention, and they need to elaborately plan these things. If you're like a super mega fan you might not really care and just be happy to see your favorite celebrity more which is ok I guess. But for the average person imagine Michael Jackson comes on stage and he doesn't sing, or sits down the entire time, and just watches the audience for 2-3 hours you know how boring that would be. People love Michael Jackson but still maybe not MJ (bad example) but ANY artist it just like the easiest money glitch they can pull out just to sell tickets, sell merch, or whatever. All they need to do is hoot and holler and hop around a little bit and that's it Money. It's just a shame to me what Live musical performance has become.",

They usually haven't bought a screen so it's a movie with the texture of drywall, or wavy like a not-taut sheet. Any size bigger than a reasonable TV looks like crap. The people who do have it mounted correctly with a good screen have completely dominated their living space for it, and often still haven't invested in good audio, maybe a sound bar so far from the picture as to be unsettling. They always keep the curtains closed so it can be dark enough to see well which makes everything so depressing and it just never seems to be dark enough. The inputs are often more limited and need switching out or else added hardware to switch devices. Then you have bulb replacements, and of course the fact that walking in front of it is way more annoying than a TV, when sitting with others you have to sit not only with an unobstructive view of the picture, but away from the projection beam. \n\nMovie theaters are big and purpose-built to avoid the projection from being blocked easily, but at home that's not going to be recreated well.

Still, they don't dabble in CPUs. And, they make some high-quality GPUs, even if they are overpriced (my Asus Cerberus 1050Ti 4GB OC still slays in most games). \n\nWe desperately need a new company to make their own CPUs or GPUs. More competition means that the big three have huge threats on their market share. Companies having a race in technological advancements and in pricing is a good thing. Evidence of that is AMD - they are chasing the mid-range market now, which is most gamers. Why? Because mid-range is what most people use.\n\nThey know that they can't compete in the high-end due to Nvidia just having overall better high-end GPUs, and so they compete in mid-range with prices. I am considering getting a more modern AMD GPU solely because of that reason. \n\nAMD is the king of price to performance, while Nvidia is the kind of performance. ",

We should just say there is one long day (Fall Back), one short day (Spring Forward), and 363 regular ass days. \n\nFall back is cool first simply because it\u2019s a bigger day than all the others. 25 hours. And why? Because we *can.* We can make ourselves a holiday and the gift for everyone is an extra hour added to our own personal time, what better gift could there be?? (unless you work graveyard, sry) I think this sort of \u201cabundance spirit\u201d is very appropriate for the fall months with their harvest festival heritage. \n\nFurthermore, Fall Back is poignantly balanced by Spring Forward, a more stoic spring holiday where we remember that to receive, we must also be willing to give. \n\nThe idea that we can come together as a group and get on board with having a long and short day is honestly charming to me.

They celebrate both the gift (Fall Back) and responsibility (Spring Forward) of the time we have available to us in our lives. We\u2019re just clinging to an outdated and supremely un-fun interpretation of them when we say they only exist to \u201csave daylight\u201d or whatever the original reason was, like that even matters anymore.

With that, they became some of my favorite creators of music.\n\nBUT, they seem to be one of those bands the internet just collectively agrees to hate on for whatever reason. The onslaught of them is so prevalent on any musical comment section I read that isn't from the Train YouTube channel. However, I completely disagree in every way. Just by looking at just some of their songs...\n\nDrops of Jupiter is incredibly meaningful and captivating. About how after death, our loved ones will continue to live on amongst the heavens, gloriously transcending the galaxy and beyond. Drive By is a wonderful, catchy, and bittersweet message of remaining hopeful that our romantic relationships will indeed endure the hardships and work out in the end. Hey Soul Sister is a fun little tune of the small things noticed in a soulmate that caused the falling for them in the first place. Shake Up Christmas sets the December mood perfectly of how we may feel stressed and frantic during the holiday season but in the end of the day, spreading joy to others is its main priority. 50 Ways to Say Goodbye is a hilarious and super entertaining breakup chorus needed for when we need to move on from our problematic exes through humor instead of anger. Calling All Angles is a deep reflection about calling on your better self while dealing with the inner struggles we all go through. And Marry Me is simply one of the best songs that can be used for either a proposal or walking down the aisle on the best day of your life.\n\nThe only criticism I can agree with is their occasional choice of unfitting words sprinkled in their otherwise great lyrics (i.e. fried chicken, so gangsta). But Freddie Mercury also randomly dropped \"fried chicken\" in One Vision and I don't see anyone criticizing that. So, I'll keep enjoying my Train and will continue to feel they're incredibly special in the musical field. Peace.",

        "text": "Ok, so I'm a dog person. I have a half black lab half St. Bernard, he's about 5 years old. I love all dogs his size, but small dogs piss me off, specifically ones like, 25 pounds and under. Chihuahuas, toy poodles, Shih Tzu's, Pomeranians, Maltese, Yorkshire Terrier, those kinds of dogs.\n\nI have never once been attacked by a large dog. However, I have been bit by a dog before, and that dog was a chihuahua I was petting. It wasn't too bad, but it still hurt and bled a bit. The owner then proceeded to blame me for making her dog bit me as \"he doesn't do that with other people.\"\n\nAnd that's another reason, the owners. All owners of small dogs that I've met can never just accept that their dogs suck. They don't feel the need to train them, so they run and people and nip people and get away with it. And the owner either fully denies that their dog acts like that, or blame you for doing something to their dog.\n\nGoing back to my dog, he's a very good boy. He's large, about 110 pounds, but he's very well trained, to the point where we often leave him off leash around our house and he won't sprint to the road to try and meet people. He is extremely calm with dogs his size as if they meet on a walk they'll usually just like, bark at each other and move on. But when smaller dogs go near my dog on a walk they try and run at him or attack him, which aggitates him. And of course the owner of the smaller dog blames me when I'm just minding my own business and her dog came up to mine!\n\nFinally, small dogs just make me nervous. Their barking is high pitched and it makes me panic, they never stop trying to jump on me or climb on me, and the owners think I'm weird for wanting their dog off of me.\n\nNow obviously there's acceptions. My cousin has a small like, 3 pound dog, and he's one of the sweetest dogs in the world. But most small dogs genuinely suck and I hate them. ",

        "text": "This applies to TV/games/books especially. This theme is highly-constricting with little payoff\n\n**1. Pirates are, by definition, outlaws making it difficult to establish believable relations with other powers**\n\nBelievable pirates are raiders of the sea, so unlikely they will have many friends, even amongst other pirate crew. If your MC pirate crew is somehow friends with many others, then they aren't really pirates and more like some Mary-Sue fantasy fulfillment. This makes establishing impactful conflict in the story difficult as every faction would realistically be hostile.\n\n**2. Being pirates also makes establishing motivation difficult**\n\nLots of drama comes from a \"saving the world\" plot. It works for other themes as maybe morality would compel the MC to act, but being a pirate means they shouldn't really bother about world-destroying affairs. After all, they are already scrapping by to survive, the town/city/kingdom being destroyed would really not be any more concern of theirs. So what motivation is there to keep the audience invested?\n\n**3. Even if the plot somehow forces a redemption arc, it makes the whole premise rather useless**\n\nMaybe then, it could be a tale of redemption of the pirate crew, but the majority of the storyline would then require them to act out-of-character to what a pirate is being about and it makes the plot predictable, dull and cheesy - something like StarWars Battlefront II's Imperial pilots campaign.\n\nAt that point, you might as well scrap the pirate theme entirely\n\nWhere could pirates work? I think realistically it has to be a self-contained story like in a 90min movie or they would really only exist as a minor faction in a bigger story ",

All scenes start and end with a dramatic tone. No mischief, comic relief, perplexity etc.\n* Far fewer locations than GoT (another soap opera staple)\n* The family trees are all nestled up as they always are in soap operas; and\u00a0**all events unfolding are about the family trees**, just like in soap operas.\n   * In GoT; for instance, the slow and ominous emergence of winter, the fire god, the rebirth of dragon power; Denaerys, Arya and Jon Snow's roads from nothing to greatness, would drive the action over many seasons and would breathe life into the interpersonal drama.\n\nIn conclusion, the G.R.R.Martin seasons of GoT were known for their cinematic feel, for their stinging and unique dialogue and surprising, untraditional twists and turns - all credibly based in historical events.\n\nSure, HoD is \"engaging\", but so are most soap operas.

I've been to weddings where the couple have spent upwards of 50k and it wasn't a 50k experience purely because the entire concept is basically partying with inlaws. I know the day isn't about the guests, but if I was to spend that kind of money I would want the people I've spent thousands on to have a memorable expierence and non of the weddings I've been to were memorable. Dosnt matter how well planned, how much money, what DJ was playing - a cake is a cake, it's a free dinner and drinks, it's crowded and contrived. The entire concept of traditional wedding days just suck full stop. ",

According to the internet, Rock Music isn\u2019t as mainstream as Pop and Rock because it\u2019s more expensive and people prefer 1 person over a group of people. The ladder is stupid to hear to me. There are definitely some good rock bands in 2024, but they aren\u2019t mainstream, making them hidden to the general Public.",

It\u2019s exclusive, unnecessary and rude. \n\nEDIT: I understand that there are levels of friends of course - I just mean that using the  term itself with lower level friends is unnecessarily pointing out the difference. And yes it\u2019s partly jealousy - I think that logically follows! Therefore a bummer. It\u2019s like mentioning that I\u2019m JV, not Varsity. I\u2019m fully aware of the order but it\u2019s sort of a dig to hear about it when it\u2019s not necessary to point out. Just say \u201cfriend\u201d or \u201cbaseball player\u201d. You know?\n\nEDIT 2: ok say you have Miranda, Carrie, Samantha & Charlotte at brunch. They are all close friends, no particular hierarchy. It would definitely be a buzzkill for the others if Carrie started chit chatting about her *best* friend (some other person who isn\u2019t there and who isn\u2019t friends with everyone else) - \u201cWell my best friend Rachel & I were shopping the other day, and \u2026.\u201d Like what are we chopped liver? We\u2019re sitting here having brunch with you. We\u2019re your friends and Rachel is your friend. is it necessary to make the \u201cbest\u201d distinction in this moment?

When I was younger, I struggled with shyness and low self-esteem, which led many to form incorrect opinions about me. Once they got to know me better, they would often express surprise at how different I was from their initial assumptions. They sometimes believed that my quietness meant I thought I was superior to them, but that was far from the truth. This kind of misunderstanding is common and usually fades away once people take the time to really get to know each other. My advice to everyone is to avoid jumping to conclusions based on appearances. Each person has their own unique personality, and please know that not everyone will behave or react the same way you do. We often make the mistake of assuming that our way of interacting is the only way, which can come off as a bit arrogant if you ask me. Just because someone is not very talkative does not mean they are unfriendly; they might just be feeling out of place or unsure of themselves in a new environment. Instead of pressuring someone to open up by asking why they are quiet, it is better to give them space and time. The more you push them to explain their behavior, the less likely they are to feel comfortable sharing their thoughts with you. Be patient and understanding, just allow them to reveal themselves at their own pace. By doing this, you create a more welcoming atmosphere for them - that is just the way I see it",

It is essential to recognize that the perception of a narrative can vary among many people, particularly between those who are new to a genre and those who have extensive experience with it.  A person may not be well-acquainted with the common tropes and predictable resolutions that often characterize a genre, while a seasoned mystery enthusiast may have encountered many of these elements before. This disparity in familiarity can influence how each reader perceives the unfolding of the story. Consequently, a well-executed narrative should resonate with everyone regardless of their prior exposure to similar themes or plots.Ultimately, a truly captivating story should maintain its appeal upon subsequent readings. If the narrative is crafted with skill and depth, it should provide a rewarding experience each time it is revisited, allowing others to discover new nuances and insights with every engagement.

The entertainment just looks too clean now. It's too perfect to the point where they're so generic, bland, and boringly repetitive to the point where I turn on any show or movie, or go to the movies I can predict what happens next. It's almost too perfect in a sense. More below:\n\nI'm all welcome to whatever next show or movie is the best, but seeing the recent trailers for things and all recent movies and shows, it just follows the same, bland tryhard formula. And don't worry, it's not just the franchises, It's everywhere. Even in new movies, repeating the same action formula, the same drama formula, same comedy spiffs, same horror spiffs. Everywhere! It's horrible!  \nI guess you could say I'm more into the film industry than many people, but even the cameras seem too clean. Too \"8k ultra, clean, no noise.\" The scripts and dialogue are something from an 8th graders fan fiction of some previous story set in an alternate reality.\n\nAnd I'm going to admit, there have been some fun things in theaters (as of recently), but IMO one movie doesn't necessary have to spawn off of another story, such as sequels or reboots, and for the past 4 or so years, almost everything besides indie films and a few exceptions are freakin' sequels, reboots, or spinoffs.  \nYou can analyze the most popular, or decently known franchises and tell that they are \"trying to make new stories\" but they're just the \"stories they've already told, re-imagined/new stories in the same universe.\"\n\nAnd As I'm speaking, they're even considering, and already have sequel-ed/rebooted classic movies for the money in them, nothing else. Not passion, just they're trying too hard.\n\nAt the end of the day, all we want is bada\\*\\* action sequences, some drama/crime stories, or a silly comedy to make us laugh, or even an original horror movie. Now they're trying too hard to make something \"worthwhile\" or \"the next star wars\" etc... you get the point or trying to \"relate to a new audience on the same movie.\" hence all the remakes and sequels and stuff.\n\nI feel at this point all the major studios are worried about is, \"When can X sequel to X franchise be out!\" not, \"What other scripts or ideas do we have to work with besides franchises.\"\n\nEvery time I go on film twitter or other forums its \"We've just announced the Xth installment to X franchise.\" and it's like... nobody cares... that franchise is dead! Leave it alone! - and then they make 2 sequel movies to profit off of a 20 year old movie that was meant to be a one alone movie.\n\nIt's one thing to have an established franchise, its another thing to try too hard to milk it for profits and not to care about the story.",

Sand is better than basically everything alternative I have seen.\n\nPros of sand:\n\nIt's soft and breaks falls, and doesn't have any sharp bits. (You'd *think* a playground not having sharp or hard substrate should be a given, right? Apparently not.)\n\nLiquid messes are mostly self-cleaning.\n\nIt doesn't get soggy in the rain.\n\nIt doesn't make your clothes dirty.\n\nIt's not a choking hazard. (I don't recommend eating *any* playground substrate, but you know kids. At least make it not immediately fatal if they do.)\n\nWhen it inevitably gets tracked out of the playground, it's not harmful to the environment. Just makes the soil a bit drier.\n\nIt's a toy in itself. Every recess I spent in a sand playground as a kid, there was always someone building or digging in the sand.\n\nCons:\n\nIt can be thrown at other kids and hurt their eyes. (But it's far less damaging than some of the newer substrates when thrown!)\n\nIf there's cats in the neighborhood, they might poop in the sandpit.\n\nThere are two other substrates I've seen that are inferior to sand but still acceptable - dirt and solid rubber.\n\nDirt is pretty similar to sand, except that it's dirty, and after a rain it turns to mud. (Which is also a safe, fun play material for kids, but they'll need a bath, preferably before getting back in the car.)\n\nSolid rubber breaks falls and doesn't have choking hazards as long as it's not damaged, and it also has the benefit of not being usable as a weapon at all. But it is harder to clean, and if it does break down, it's harmful to the environment. And it's not a toy in its own right.\n\nAnd then there's the unacceptable substrates - gravel, rubber bits and wood chips.\n\nGravel is hard, sharp, and both a choking hazard and a potentially lethal projectile. It doesn't break falls, in fact it breaks *you* if you fall. (My 2yo recently fell from a swing onto gravel and was gushing blood from her head. She's fine, but if it had been sand she'd have been unhurt.)\n\nRubber bits aren't hard or sharp, but they're choking hazards. And they get readily tracked out of the play area and become environmental pollutants.\n\nWood chips are the *worst*. They're hard, sharp and have splinters! The only pro is that they're biodegradable, so eventually a wood chip playground will become a dirt playground if not regularly maintained. Unfortunately, I think most of the wood chip playgrounds I've seen are being maintained by misguided people who think wood chips are remotely acceptable in a playground.\n\nWhat will they think of next? Glass shards?",

Cooking utensils, DIY tools. You forget to switch off the oven or you fail to empty the dryer lint for a few months, and sudden the house is in flames. You ate the wrong diet and now your entire body is riddled with micro plastics that you had no way of knowing where in your food. \n\nThe same is true for so much of the modern world. Relatively innocuous looking things can mete out life-changing effects. And there are thousands of these things that you have to mentally track, even if in a small way, or else. It requires part of the brain to always be switched on to threats in our environment. Anxiety seems to be a perfectly rational adaptation to this.\n\nWhile the ancient world was more deadly, at least the threats back then would have been immediate and obvious. ",

I feel like a lot of people accept things from partners that they would never accept from a friend because they see them as two different things . Technically they are, but they share  a common ground and that\u2019s friendship. \n\nI feel like because society conditions us to believe that we need to find a romantic partner, a lot of people settle for less than a best friend in a life partner. People also have started to look for partnerships in such inorganic ways. For example, the TV show Love Is Blind or the pop the balloon shows on YouTube. When I think of how a friendship sparks, there\u2019s usually some type of organic meeting in the beginning. For example, I made friends in a class I take because we share that interest. Imagine going onto a show like Love Is Blind or pop the balloon to find a friend. It would feel so fake and forced. Obviously there are exceptions but finding genuine people won\u2019t happen more often than not that way.\n\nSince becoming an adult, I have became more intentional about creating meaningful friendships. Because of this I have had less and less friends, over the past six years I\u2019ve only met three solid friends however to me that is more precious than having 10 friends I\u2019m not sure if I can rely on.  My point is finding a good life partner is something that will come to you if you let it, but when you try to force it and it becomes an objective you cannot shake you start to settle for less or become desperate. I personally feel like this contributes to a lot of people ending up in unhappy relationships. \nMaybe if people didn\u2019t so much importance on the idea of finding a lifelong partner and instead placed importance on how they can fulfill their own or create their own happiness, even without a romantic partner, they may find that happy and genuine connections come to them more easily.

Professional sports are a one-way, transactional relationship - the fans buy tickets, merch, etc, the team *maybe* gives them some success in return. Obviously, there is the consensus that say living in New York and being a Knicks fan means you are together with others through the highs and lows, but never forget, the franchise will never care if you stop cheering for them in good or bad.\n\nYes there should be some razzing if someone decides to ditch their awful team for a very good one (ex: a Jets fan becomes a Chiefs fan), but pouring your heart and soul into letting a terrible franchise dictate your mood every week (NFL) or multiple times per week (NBA, NHL) is wild.\n",

If we do end up failing the test however, we usually get 3 more attempts at the MCAS across the entirety of high school, and if you don't pass after 4 attempts, you don't graduate. The thing is, you only need about 40% on the test to score above Not Meeting Expectations from what I have seen with my friends, and you have the entire school day to complete the test. This is easily doable if you have basic math, english, and science skills that are tested on the MCAS, especially considering most of the test is multiple-choice. I feel like if we get rid of state standardized tests like MCAS, then this will make it so that people who don't know basic math or english can graduate, lowering the value of the high school diploma even more than it already has been, and the kids who would have not passed the MCAS even after multiple attempts will graduate, leading them to struggle a lot in the real world due to not having basic reading/writing or math skills.",

        "text": "Ok, I get why that phrase gets such a bad reaction sometimes: Because some people use it inappropriately. When people are justifiably angry about something wrong, and that anger is in proportion, they shouldn't be told to \"calm down\". It shouldn't be used as a way to stop discussion of something you did wrong. But the fact that some people misuse it doesn't mean it shouldn't ever be said by anyone. A lot of common phrases are appropriate in some situations and inappropriate in others. \n\n\n\nLet's say that someone is \"expressing\" anger that is way out of proportion to the situation... Imagine if I asked my wife to get milk on her way home and she forgot, then I absolutely exploded on her with cuss words and insults. I would love to hear the explanation of why she should just \"listen and empathize\" but absolutely not tell me to \"calm down\". Nobody would regard this as anything but me being extremely cruel to her. \n\n\n\nPeople do things like this sometimes, and they should be told to bring it down. Everyone wants outlets to express anger, but it can rise to a level where it is simply a rage problem. People don't deserve to be the target of rage when they've done nothing wrong or something very minor. \n\n\n\nAs an aside, the people I've heard rail against the phrase \"calm down\" are usually the first to tell others - in some words or another - that they need to do exactly that when the other person is angry with them. It's like they want a special privileged status where they can blow up with rage on whoever they want and shouldn't have to be told to stop, but they demand the most kind, gentle treatment for themselves.",

One of the best known examples is with cable, internet, and telephone companies. For a long time now, it's pretty well established that, as soon as you call their customer service and start threatening to cancel your contract, you get referred to people whose only job is to get you to stay on at almost any cost. Generally, this comes in the form of a lowered monthly rate, free upgrades and the like.\n2. Among content creators, it has become painfully clear in the last few years that, despite their big talk of \"fair and impartial moderation\", platforms like YouTube and Twitch will only get off their asses and do their jobs when creators call them out on social media and unleash a shitstorm of public outrage. And even then, it's still sometimes a bit of a coin toss.\n\nThis naturally doesn't excuse the behavior of the classic Karens we're familiar with, but there are definitely some sectors where the powers that be not only enable this behavior, but also sometimes make it the only way to even get them to do their jobs.",

Originally, Halloween was supposed to be an anthology series - a different spooky story centered around Halloween every movie. But after the first film, Michael Myers was so popular that they kept bringing him back, shifting the franchise away from its original concept.\n\nThis is why Halloween 3 is its own standalone story with a completely different plot and no Michael Myers. A lot of people hated it because they were expecting more Michael, but I think it showed what the franchise could have been and instead is now just wasted potential.\n\nInstead, we got a long series of sequels, reboots, and retcons, with Michael\u2019s story growing more convoluted each time. While Michael is iconic, I feel the series could have just brought so much more to the table than it did. Halloween could have been a much broader exploration of fear and the supernatural around the holiday. They even could have done a spin-off featuring Michael Myers if they wanted to.\n\nTL;DR: Halloween was supposed to be an anthology series, and while Michael Myers is cool, the franchise would\u2019ve been more interesting if each movie told a new Halloween-inspired story.",

I've always looked several years younger than my age and I've always had slim/athletic build and started growing late so by the time I hit my twenties I grew to be 5'7. So as of right now when I've been told I look like I'm in my late teens- sometimes early twenties. My problem isn't really the way I look, it's often the reactions from the people I encounter or them just making up their minds before they can figure out what's going on or sometimes even think I'm lying about being 29 of all ages. It was at its worse up until I started growing facial hair and started bulking up a little.  Cops and even sometimes people would think I am cutting school, when I already finished. People would give me weird looks and ask me my age when I'm already in a place for adults. And don't get me started on the things I encountered, at work back then. The remarks I get \"You look too young to work\", \"you really work here?\", \"How old are you?\" \" how did you get a job working Healthcare at 14?\" Most of that stuff I don't really deal with no more and brush it off when it does occur but it really is irritating. Especially when I'm at work still to this day. Because this all goes back to people making up their damn Minds before they realize what's going on or they just can't read the room. I work as a DSP and a behavioral house for young men with mental and behavioral issues. It's a pretty cool gig but since I look about the clients' ages every now and then someone who hasn't been to the group home will see me doing something a staff member would and will try to stop me like I'm a client or even talk down to me. And when I tell them who I am a few will say\" Are you sure?\" Like why would I lie saying that I work here and I punched in codes only staff members would no to access the required items I need? I understand people make mistakes but this can get frustrating.\n Here I am either trying to do my job or do something else and some random is trying give me some two cents. Now I can take criticism but being talked down to can be irritating. And as for compliments I don't mind them either. It's just annoying when people over exaggerate or try to say that I look like I belong in high school as if it's one. It can be very condescending. This also can be a double standard. You wouldn't like it if somebody said oh you look old or you're fat. So why do people do it people who look young and small?\nI hope people could relate to this and as for the people that can't, I hope they can learn from this.",

        "text": "The term \"nerd\" is often used to label someone who is intelligent, diligent, or focused on their studies. For instance, if someone feels jealous of your academic success or notices how well you manage your assignments, they might refer to you as a nerd. Interestingly, the word can also be used in a more neutral sense to highlight someone's passion or expertise in a specific area, like calling someone a \"science nerd\" or a \"history nerd.\" for example. Being labeled a nerd typically means you don't fit into the popular or athletic groups, but rather, you think for yourself and have unique interests that set you apart. Embracing your nerdy side can actually be a strength. It means you have a different way of seeing the world, picking up on details and insights that others might overlook. This unique perspective can give you a kind of intelligence that isn't just about grades but also about understanding life in a deeper way. You might find that your interests lead you to discover things that others miss, giving you a special kind of street smarts that is valuable in its own right. So, instead of trying to conform to what others expect, celebrate your individuality. Don't waste your energy on trying to fit in or pretending to be someone you're not; that would be a disservice to your true potential. When someone calls you nerdy, take it as a compliment, as long as it is meant in a positive way. Being a nerd is not a bad thing; it means you have the courage to be yourself and pursue what you love, regardless of what others think",

        "text": "So I\u2019ve seen a lot of people use attachment theory because nowadays labels are popular and self-diagnosis is so common. For those that don\u2019t know, it\u2019s the \u201canxious, disorganized, avoidant and secure\u201d types of attachment. \n\nI\u2019ve been to therapy and funnily enough, my therapist also said he dislikes attachment theory and doesn\u2019t use that at all for his patients. Because it doesn\u2019t make sense to generalize excessively and apply broad strokes to things that sometimes do depend on circumstance and many factors.\n\n\nFor example, if you\u2019re falling in love with someone for real and they pull away and start showing less interest because they never really liked you, EVERYBODY is going to feel bad. Everybody is going to feel anxious about that. And the toxic thing is to put it like it\u2019s your problem, when in reality, it\u2019s the relationship that\u2019s the problem. \n\nAttachment styles are toxic because they can pathologize perfectly normal reactions to difficult or unhealthy dynamics. In a situation where someone is genuinely losing interest or becoming distant, feeling hurt or anxious is a natural response, not a sign of an attachment \u201cissue.\u201d Framing it as such risks making someone internalize blame for what might actually be a one-sided or unstable relationship.\n\nWhen attachment styles are overemphasized, they can become a kind of self-blame mechanism, where people try to \u201cfix\u201d themselves to accommodate behavior that isn\u2019t respectful or reciprocal.\n\nIf I may add personal experience, I\u2019ve fallen into this self-blaming BS and also gaslighting in a relationship when all along I just had to cut them off. Bottom line is don\u2019t question what you feel, don\u2019t feel any shame for your love language, and also don\u2019t try to accommodate or question yourself to what others say. It\u2019s a complete fucking waste of time. For the same reason that it\u2019s socially acceptable that nobody owes you anything and that anyone can leave you at any second. Be in a relationship in your own terms. If it doesn\u2019t align with the other person, then cut the relationship for the best of both sides. Real happy relationships work when you don\u2019t question yourself and can be yourself freely and without shame. Real relationships have commitment and dedication. Don\u2019t settle for less. \n\n\nAnd also they\u2019re a waste of time, because if I take myself as an example and analyze other relationships, I perfectly fall into the 4 categories of attachment depending on what specific relationship I think of.\n\n\n",

Regardless of what canon we go with, the whole thing feels useless. If we go off by Lucas's original plan for the sequel trilogy, Darth Maul (Dark side user but not sith), was still alive and would be the next big bad. If we go by Disney canon, Palpatine never actually died and so neither did the sith.\n\nEither way, the prophecy just seems so insignificant. Dark side users still exist. Sure, depending on what you consider canon (GeorgeVerse or Disney), the sith were wiped out but that hardly feels like balancing the force.\n\nIts like if we completely wiped out every Isis member and then celebrated as if every terrorist all over the world was gone. Like sure, you defeated this one group, but it didn't really make much of a dent in the grand scheme.\n\nEven if all dark side users were wiped out by Anakin Skywalker (Until the sequels that is), it would only have lasted a couple decades. I mean imagine a thousand years being, even unintentionally, dedicated to the eventual death of the sith. The suffering of Anakin Skywalker and many other Jedi eventually culminating into the force being balanced only for it to last a couple decades.\n\nIn conclusion, I feel like the chosen one prophecy was pretty useless no matter how you take it, and wanted to see if there was something I didn't understand",

        "text": "I think a good example to make this point is look at the stark differences between the Twister Movie made in the late 90\u2019s and the modern twister movie in 2024. \n\nThe old Twister had a more detailed in depth experience to the characters and we really got to know them and \u201changout\u201d with them throughout the movie. There wasn\u2019t as much exposition dumping and the movie had its \u201cmoments\u201d but most was pretty grounded. Compare this to the modern twisters movie and it\u2019s like most modern movies in the sense that they try too hard for every character to have this popping personality, and trying to make you like them with the abrupt moments of them dumping exposition and attempts at so many one liners for comedic relief. I\u2019m not against films giving us exposition and giving us comedic relief at times but the film also doesn\u2019t have to hold our hand and try to be witty so much at the same time.\n\nAnother thing to note is modern movies look \u201ctoo perfect\u201d. Older films did it better with CGI imo. The newer CGI looks too clean (for a lack of a better way to explain it) and takes me out of the immersion. \n\nI can also use the example of the top gun films. Of course there was unrealistic moments in the first Top Gun film but the modern one was way too much with how unrealistic it was for the sake of Hollywood moments. I know some people are gonna have ZERO issue with this but imo this happens too much with modern movies. \n\nMindless entertainment isn\u2019t inherently bad but I just feel like we are in a movie slump atm that just tries a \u201csafe formula\u201d that\u2019s based off comedic relief one liners, shoving information in our faces because they\u2019re afraid we won\u2019t follow what\u2019s going on, and these ridiculous moments/scenes that try too hard to make us go \u201cwow\u201d.\n\nSide note: you can apply this to a lot of modern video games as well ",

Shape was already sacrificed for a uniform design, at least on Android and iOS, these days all icons are usually round, squares or squircles. \n\nPosition is flexible, I guess most people sort them for muscle memory, but it shouldn't be the primary thing, especially for stuff you use rarely. If we only have design (which have already become simpler during the last decade) and colour left, why sacrifice one of them just cause it looks a tiny bit nicer? So you have to search a little bit longer and stare a little bit more intensely to find your stuff? And that's assuming you still have good eyesight. \n\nOther argument I've seen was \"less distracting, makes you use your phone less\". Stupid IMO. If it makes your life harder, delete the app ffs, don't have the UI fight your worst instincts. Next time we can, in the name of less distraction, just place textboxes only, no, frick the whole GUI, too distracting, command line only, DOS rules.

Unless you plan to spend your entire vacation in your room, there are way better things to splurge on.\n\nI've done a good amount of travelling in the last decade and have stayed in a variety of different places in many different countries. On a few occasions (usually when travelling for work), I've had the chance to stay in some nicer hotels. What became clear to me is that while I certainly appreciated some amenites (nicer bed, bigger bathroom, good breakfast), I've never really found myself wishing I had \"upgraded\". \n\nAt the end of the day, a hotel (or holiday apartment or whatever) is just a place to rest and recharge between your vacation activities. Sure, it can be nice to have a really good breakfast to start the day or visit the hotel restaurant when you don't feel like going out, but even a top- quality buffet or restaurant isn't really worth it. \n\nMost vacation destinations have lots of good local restaurants and bars around them (actual local restaurants, not \"local\" tourist traps) with food and drink that is both significantly better and probably cheaper that what the hotel has to offer. To give an example:\n\nI like to visit a city named D\u00fcsseldorf a lot. It has a vibrant Japanese community and there is a neighborhood there called Little Tokyo. It's chock- full of restaurants and bars (many run and staffed by Japanese people) and there are even some Japanese supermarkets where you can go for a nice \"Conbini Lunch\" (\"Convenience Store\" lunch- trust me, they're actually really good). You can even find a lot of the \"high- end\" amenities like spas in the area- with significantly more reasonable prices than you'd find in your hotel's in- house spa.\n\nUnless you can get it **super** cheap or someone else is paying for it, I find that it's just not worth it to pay what may be 4x or more per night for luxury accomodations. Instead, it's best to look for a hotel that's just *good enough* (clean, things aren't broken, etc.) and instead use the money you save to splurge a little more on things that you wouldn't be able to find at home.",

A lot of listening parties are messy there is no choreography or showmanship. A lot of times it's the singer/artist and their buddies hopping on the stage and dancing or whatever and people are just praising them for just releasing the music. Back in the day artists had to actually perform or be talented or impressive. Work to capture the audience's attention, and they need to elaborately plan these things. If you're like a super mega fan you might not really care and just be happy to see your favorite celebrity more which is ok I guess. But for the average person imagine Michael Jackson comes on stage and he doesn't sing, or sits down the entire time, and just watches the audience for 2-3 hours you know how boring that would be. People love Michael Jackson but still maybe not MJ (bad example) but ANY artist it just like the easiest money glitch they can pull out just to sell tickets, sell merch, or whatever. All they need to do is hoot and holler and hop around a little bit and that's it Money. It's just a shame to me what Live musical performance has become.",

They usually haven't bought a screen so it's a movie with the texture of drywall, or wavy like a not-taut sheet. Any size bigger than a reasonable TV looks like crap. The people who do have it mounted correctly with a good screen have completely dominated their living space for it, and often still haven't invested in good audio, maybe a sound bar so far from the picture as to be unsettling. They always keep the curtains closed so it can be dark enough to see well which makes everything so depressing and it just never seems to be dark enough. The inputs are often more limited and need switching out or else added hardware to switch devices. Then you have bulb replacements, and of course the fact that walking in front of it is way more annoying than a TV, when sitting with others you have to sit not only with an unobstructive view of the picture, but away from the projection beam. \n\nMovie theaters are big and purpose-built to avoid the projection from being blocked easily, but at home that's not going to be recreated well.

But still, they gave up on high-end GPUs due to Nvidia's dominance, and are instead starting to dominate the CPU market. I have an AMD CPU (Ryzen 5 7600x).\n\nIntel had dominance in the CPU department, but due to their GPU / Arc efforts, their CPU quality has been going down recently. \n\nNvidia has total GPU dominance, both in servers' and in gamers' markets. Still, they don't dabble in CPUs. And, they make some high-quality GPUs, even if they are overpriced (my Asus Cerberus 1050Ti 4GB OC still slays in most games). \n\nWe desperately need a new company to make their own CPUs or GPUs. More competition means that the big three have huge threats on their market share. Companies having a race in technological advancements and in pricing is a good thing. Evidence of that is AMD - they are chasing the mid-range market now, which is most gamers. Why? Because mid-range is what most people use.\n\nThey know that they can't compete in the high-end due to Nvidia just having overall better high-end GPUs, and so they compete in mid-range with prices. I am considering getting a more modern AMD GPU solely because of that reason. \n\nAMD is the king of price to performance, while Nvidia is the kind of performance. ",

I actually don\u2019t care at all about the nomenclature of \u201cstandard\u201d time vs \u201cdaylight savings\u201d time and think those labels should be dropped completely. We should just say there is one long day (Fall Back), one short day (Spring Forward), and 363 regular ass days. \n\nFall back is cool first simply because it\u2019s a bigger day than all the others. 25 hours. And why? Because we *can.* We can make ourselves a holiday and the gift for everyone is an extra hour added to our own personal time, what better gift could there be?? (unless you work graveyard, sry) I think this sort of \u201cabundance spirit\u201d is very appropriate for the fall months with their harvest festival heritage. \n\nFurthermore, Fall Back is poignantly balanced by Spring Forward, a more stoic spring holiday where we remember that to receive, we must also be willing to give. \n\nThe idea that we can come together as a group and get on board with having a long and short day is honestly charming to me. You can tell me it\u2019s silly but so is Easter. You can tell me it\u2019s annoying and makes things slightly more complicated for a brief period of time but so does every holiday parade that closes down traffic. You can tell me it disrupts sleep rhythms, but even more so does getting on a plane and crossing multiple times zones, which people do for holidays all the time. \n\nAs far as holidays go, Fall Back and Spring Forward are some of the best we\u2019ve come up with so far imo. They celebrate both the gift (Fall Back) and responsibility (Spring Forward) of the time we have available to us in our lives. We\u2019re just clinging to an outdated and supremely un-fun interpretation of them when we say they only exist to \u201csave daylight\u201d or whatever the original reason was, like that even matters anymore.

After looking into their discography, I realized the variety of songs I looked forward to hearing everyday on the radio as a kid were all by the same people. With that, they became some of my favorite creators of music.\n\nBUT, they seem to be one of those bands the internet just collectively agrees to hate on for whatever reason. The onslaught of them is so prevalent on any musical comment section I read that isn't from the Train YouTube channel. However, I completely disagree in every way. Just by looking at just some of their songs...\n\nDrops of Jupiter is incredibly meaningful and captivating. About how after death, our loved ones will continue to live on amongst the heavens, gloriously transcending the galaxy and beyond. Drive By is a wonderful, catchy, and bittersweet message of remaining hopeful that our romantic relationships will indeed endure the hardships and work out in the end. Hey Soul Sister is a fun little tune of the small things noticed in a soulmate that caused the falling for them in the first place. Shake Up Christmas sets the December mood perfectly of how we may feel stressed and frantic during the holiday season but in the end of the day, spreading joy to others is its main priority. 50 Ways to Say Goodbye is a hilarious and super entertaining breakup chorus needed for when we need to move on from our problematic exes through humor instead of anger. Calling All Angles is a deep reflection about calling on your better self while dealing with the inner struggles we all go through. And Marry Me is simply one of the best songs that can be used for either a proposal or walking down the aisle on the best day of your life.\n\nThe only criticism I can agree with is their occasional choice of unfitting words sprinkled in their otherwise great lyrics (i.e. fried chicken, so gangsta). But Freddie Mercury also randomly dropped \"fried chicken\" in One Vision and I don't see anyone criticizing that. So, I'll keep enjoying my Train and will continue to feel they're incredibly special in the musical field. Peace.",

        "text": "Ok, so I'm a dog person. I have a half black lab half St. Bernard, he's about 5 years old. I love all dogs his size, but small dogs piss me off, specifically ones like, 25 pounds and under. Chihuahuas, toy poodles, Shih Tzu's, Pomeranians, Maltese, Yorkshire Terrier, those kinds of dogs.\n\nI have never once been attacked by a large dog. However, I have been bit by a dog before, and that dog was a chihuahua I was petting. It wasn't too bad, but it still hurt and bled a bit. The owner then proceeded to blame me for making her dog bit me as \"he doesn't do that with other people.\"\n\nAnd that's another reason, the owners. All owners of small dogs that I've met can never just accept that their dogs suck. They don't feel the need to train them, so they run and people and nip people and get away with it. And the owner either fully denies that their dog acts like that, or blame you for doing something to their dog.\n\nGoing back to my dog, he's a very good boy. He's large, about 110 pounds, but he's very well trained, to the point where we often leave him off leash around our house and he won't sprint to the road to try and meet people. He is extremely calm with dogs his size as if they meet on a walk they'll usually just like, bark at each other and move on. But when smaller dogs go near my dog on a walk they try and run at him or attack him, which aggitates him. And of course the owner of the smaller dog blames me when I'm just minding my own business and her dog came up to mine!\n\nFinally, small dogs just make me nervous. Their barking is high pitched and it makes me panic, they never stop trying to jump on me or climb on me, and the owners think I'm weird for wanting their dog off of me.\n\nNow obviously there's acceptions. My cousin has a small like, 3 pound dog, and he's one of the sweetest dogs in the world. But most small dogs genuinely suck and I hate them. ",

        "text": "This applies to TV/games/books especially. This theme is highly-constricting with little payoff\n\n**1. Pirates are, by definition, outlaws making it difficult to establish believable relations with other powers**\n\nBelievable pirates are raiders of the sea, so unlikely they will have many friends, even amongst other pirate crew. If your MC pirate crew is somehow friends with many others, then they aren't really pirates and more like some Mary-Sue fantasy fulfillment. This makes establishing impactful conflict in the story difficult as every faction would realistically be hostile.\n\n**2. Being pirates also makes establishing motivation difficult**\n\nLots of drama comes from a \"saving the world\" plot. It works for other themes as maybe morality would compel the MC to act, but being a pirate means they shouldn't really bother about world-destroying affairs. After all, they are already scrapping by to survive, the town/city/kingdom being destroyed would really not be any more concern of theirs. So what motivation is there to keep the audience invested?\n\n**3. Even if the plot somehow forces a redemption arc, it makes the whole premise rather useless**\n\nMaybe then, it could be a tale of redemption of the pirate crew, but the majority of the storyline would then require them to act out-of-character to what a pirate is being about and it makes the plot predictable, dull and cheesy - something like StarWars Battlefront II's Imperial pilots campaign.\n\nAt that point, you might as well scrap the pirate theme entirely\n\nWhere could pirates work? I think realistically it has to be a self-contained story like in a 90min movie or they would really only exist as a minor faction in a bigger story ",

All scenes start and end with a dramatic tone. No mischief, comic relief, perplexity etc.\n* Far fewer locations than GoT (another soap opera staple)\n* The family trees are all nestled up as they always are in soap operas; and\u00a0**all events unfolding are about the family trees**, just like in soap operas.\n   * In GoT; for instance, the slow and ominous emergence of winter, the fire god, the rebirth of dragon power; Denaerys, Arya and Jon Snow's roads from nothing to greatness, would drive the action over many seasons and would breathe life into the interpersonal drama.\n\nIn conclusion, the G.R.R.Martin seasons of GoT were known for their cinematic feel, for their stinging and unique dialogue and surprising, untraditional twists and turns - all credibly based in historical events.\n\nSure, HoD is \"engaging\", but so are most soap operas.

The human race has, in its ingenuity and creativity, created a plethora of tongues with different sounds. In a Hollywood environment growing increasingly allergic to the idea of art, the use of different languages can be one key way to return art to films and TV, on a foundation of the viewer's ability to respect the other's language. Even if it cannot be fully understood by the viewer's ear, the sounds and conciseness and heritage native to the region it's speaking in is, ultimately, of more value than the digestibility of a work that's dubbed only for the reason of that it's the viewer's native language. \n\nWhile I can understand and respect that viewers don't necessarily want to read subtitles and that hearing their native tongue is possibly the only way to engage with a work, ultimately, translation from one language to another, especially when lines have the complexities of inflection, volume and tempo to express meaning, is in and of itself a fundamentally and undeniable transformative process. To expect that a plain translation will have a 1:1 impact to the native language (especially within the reality of different cultural norms and societal expectations) is an exercise in futility. \n\nTherefore, if to adapt a work from one language to another is inescapably transformative, shouldn't we advocate a push towards exposing us to more of the spectrum of human communication beyond the comfort of our own linguistic borders? Movies and TV are, at their core, meant to take us to new places and expose us to new experiences, are they not?",

In the early 2000s having a petite figure was the ideal, now a slim thick figure is whats in, resulting in a lot if women making body agumentaions.

But if you\u2019re just visiting someone\u2019s house and you don\u2019t know them all that well, don\u2019t bring alcohol as a \u201chostess gift.\u201d If you\u2019re doing a secret Santa or gift exchange at work with coworkers you don\u2019t know intimately, don\u2019t bring alcohol. \n\nI don\u2019t drink because addiction runs in my family and I choose to avoid alcohol. My husband doesn\u2019t drink either. But every year around Christmas we end up with a couple bottles of wine in the house that we have to get rid of\u2026",

If there is little there, so be it, but if the estate is significant, then likely the recipient didn't need the money and the payer was held to an unreasonable arrangement.

I\u2019m currently playing through the *Silent Hill 2* remake, which is a medium-length game, clocking in around 15-20 hours. And even *that* feels too long.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing \u2013 for those of us aren\u2019t in high school or college anymore, we can't binge play a game for hours at a time. Life happens: work, responsibilities, maybe even relationships and social stuff. So realistically, I get about an hour a day (if I\u2019m lucky) to actually sit down and game. Sometimes days go by when I don\u2019t even touch the console.\n\nWhen a game stretches out over weeks, you end up losing a lot of the atmosphere and immersion that makes it special. I\u2019ve noticed this with *Silent Hill 2*, which is all about mood and tension. By the time I get back into it, the emotions and vibes of the story have faded, and it just starts feeling like something I need to get through.\n\nPlus, the longer games get, the more I find myself wanting something fresh before I even finish. It feels like games could benefit from being more concise \u2013 get to the point, give me a tight, memorable experience, and move on. Some of the most impactful games I\u2019ve played in recent years were under 10 hours (some even less then 5!), and they left a way stronger impression than the bloated, sprawling epics that seem to be the trend lately.\n\nAnyone else feel the same way, or am I just old?",

Then there\u2019s the ridiculous speed at which they grow. It\u2019s like they can increase their biomass out of thin air, with no actual food source, which just doesn\u2019t make sense.

And xenomorphs themselves, with all their strength and durability, seem designed solely to be terrifying without any grounding in actual biology. It's over-the-top to the point of being goofy, which takes away from the horror.\n\nThe Alien movies are also guilty of being way too predictable, especially with their crew dynamics. Every time, we\u2019re introduced to a group of supposedly trained professionals who make bafflingly dumb decisions, falling into the same traps with xenomorphs and facehuggers over and over. They\u2019ll split up, ignore obvious signs of danger, or poke around in alien goo like it's their first day on the job. It\u2019s like they\u2019ve never even heard of basic survival instincts, which makes the whole setup feel forced. After a while, it\u2019s hard to feel suspense when you know the crew\u2019s own decisions are practically a guarantee they\u2019ll run into the same nightmare.\n\nThe series would be way better if the crew was competent and professional and doing everything right, and still face difficulties.\n\n\n",

        "text": "Before I make my case, let me add a few exceptions : \n\n1. Players that were drafted by their hometown team/played for their hometown team for the most part of their career (50% >) will be given a pass. The dream of winning a big one for your city carries a huge sentimental value and we will respect that.\n2. Players that were super talented but their careers faced setbacks due to injuries, it's something they don't have any control over and it could happen to any unlucky person.\n\nNow, for the players that don't fall under these two exceptions. Yes, they don't deserve to be on the same level as players who can call themselves champions.\n\nDon't care about how good their stats were, how efficient they were or how many individual accolades they had. They were never able to taste the ultimate achievement in sports, winning a title.\n\nBefore people say that they were unlucky or circumstances just never aligned for them. Nope, a lot of these players had many chances to leave their team and go to a contender. Most of them stayed at their struggling teams because of two reasons :\n\n1. Money : A lot of them prioritized money over winning because who doesn't love money. The team owners gave whatever contract they want in order to keep their star player happy.\n2. Competition : They loved the \"big fish in a small pond\" mentality. It's easy to look good in a bad team. Nobody will question your stats at all. So it is easy to avoid competition while keeping the same star player status.\n\nMoreover, winning in sports tells a lot about what kind of leader a player is. A player who is able to lead his team to a title is far more valuable than players that fill up stat sheets with no end product.\n\nFinally, my closing remark is that this post is strictly limited to players that had superstar status in their career. So don't include role players with rings vs superstars with no rings just to make your point. This post is about players that are rated very highly in their sport in general or in the position they played, but have no title success.\n\n",

        "text": "I don't know why I have to even say this but there's been a trend online where people think it's okay to steal people's pets because any animal that goes outside is automatically \"abused\". Let me preface by saying that I am 100% for keeping your cats inside and that they destroy ecosystems and it's important to keep them safe. However, lots of people especially ones that aren't online aren't educated in this topic and enjoy having outdoor kitties, or their cats that they love and care for are a little too feral and they cannot be kept inside comfortably. The trend which I've seen a lot of on Tiktok and Twitter is that of people literally just taking whatever well fed, groomed and sometimes even with a collar or microchip pet and just like stealing it. Is this not illegal? Your first course of action should always be to educate people to keep them inside instead of ruining a very special part of their life. Imagine you take a cat from an elderly woman who has no family left and this kitty is her only lifeline and source of joy. It's just pure evil to take it away. Even if you say the movement is good, you cannot disagree that these people are selfish. What if someone steals an outdoor cat as a \"rescue\", put a collar on it and everything and try to keep it as sheltered as possible but it slips out the door. Will it get returned if people think every outdoor cat is abused? No. If everyone has the same philosophy that stealing is okay, even people that are extremely dedicated to keeping their pets indoors will not be given benefit of the doubt and their pet returned, all because of a little mistake. This hurts everybody, it's a terrible thing. I've also seen this with birds as any pigeon with a band on its feet (to signify where to return it to its owner) is automatically taken as a victim and stolen. I know many people that love their pets dearly and try to keep them happy and healthy. It's cruel to try to fix a slight wrong with such extreme measures. ",

Maybe the era of music I listen to most is just male-dominated? I just don\u2019t feel the same connection with female love songs as I do with ones written by males. Love songs written by women tend to be more receptive I think, and maybe that\u2019s just not something I respond to well? Women that combat this that come to mind are Lana Del Ray, Katie Melua, and Dolores O\u2019Riordan from the Cranberries. There\u2019s probably others but maybe I just am ignorant. Obviously this doesn\u2019t apply to all male artists and especially any modern artists as romance doesn\u2019t seem to be in very much anymore. \n\nExamples of love songs written by male artists that I think encapsulate my theory well:\n\nJust Like Heaven/Underneath the Stars - The Cure \nBy Starlight - Smashing Pumpkins \nEverything She Does is Magic \nInside Out - Eve 6\nSlow Dancing/If You Wear That Velvet Dress- U2\nBusted and Blue - Gorillaz \nBedshaped/Your Eyes Open/Somewhere Only We Know - Keane\nMake Love To Me Forever- Snow Patrol\nSay When - The Fray \nAbout You - 1975\nAnything 4 u - LANY\nShiver/Always in My Head/Another\u2019s Arms - Coldplay \nSong 6 - George Ezra\nDance Me to the End of Love - Leonard Cohen \nTeach Me, Ava - Bear\u2019s Den\n\nNote: Also I\u2019m not against female artists in any way or somehow saying female love is shallow compared to male love.

        "text": "I think it\u2019s often a bit naive to expect to see the members of a group whether that be a family, gender, religion, country etc who don\u2019t support the behavior of some member or members to call that member or members out for it.  For instance it may not always really be safe to call out a member or members of ones own group as that may cause those members to turn on them.  Another reason this can be an unreasonable expectation is that some of the members of a group may not always be aware of the behavior of every other member of the group, and it\u2019s hard to call out the behavior of a member or members of ones group that one isn\u2019t aware of.  Being unaware isn\u2019t always from willful ignorance either as sometimes members of one group who do a particular thing might not do it in public where it\u2019s easily visible to other members.  Also I another reason this isn\u2019t a reasonable expectation is that it take conscious effort for the member or member of a group to do something but it takes no conscious effort for other members of the group not to call it out, especially if they have other things to do.\n\nAlso sometimes if a member of a group calls out the behavior of another member or members of their group it may not be easy to recognize that that\u2019s what\u2019s happening.  For instance some members of a group may call out other members in a more private setting where its not as visible, or the members of a group who call out a member or members may not always announce or make it obvious that they are also members of that same group, or someone who calls out the behavior of a member or members of their own group might not call out the member or members who engage in that behavior but just the behavior in general, or their could be a number of other reasons you might not notice when a someone calls out a member of members of their group.",

Behaviour euthanasia is a kindness in the correct situations \n\n\nThe resources to help a dog that will never get better and is in so much pain vs a kill shelter that's able to go  this dog has a chance and we can help it . \n\n\nNo kill shelters means no dog dies and that means the dog that needs to be put down suffers and the dogs that have a chance are not getting the chances it deserves cos it's going to keeping an animal alive through human cruelty \n",

        "text": "Mathematics is undeniably important; however, it is likely that most individuals have acquired all the arithmetic and fraction skills necessary by the age of approximately 15. After this point, the focus should primarily be on maintaining these skills until adulthood. While there may be a limited need for additional arithmetic instruction, it would primarily pertain to practical applications, such as calculating a mortgage. Nevertheless, advanced mathematics is not essential, I assure you. \nIt is  important to keep math classes available, but they should not be required  for everyone. Students who excel in math should have opportunities to explore other interests, similar to how we encourage learning different languages or engaging in sports. We should consider how often we actually use advanced math in our daily lives. For most people, unless they work in specific fields that require complex calculations, like engineering or finance, the need for advanced math is minimal. In fact, with technology like computers and calculators, many of the complicated math problems can be solved easily without needing to understand the underlying concepts.  The reality is that most individuals can navigate life just fine without a solid grasp of basic math and algebra. Higher-level math is not necessary for the majority of careers, and only a small fraction of the population truly needs it for their jobs. This raises the question of why we insist on making math a requirement in schools. For many students, this approach can lead to frustration and a sense of inadequacy, taking away valuable time that could be spent on more practical subjects like critical thinking and reasoning skills. If students had stronger skills in these areas, it could lead to better outcomes in their personal and professional lives.\nSome people argue that studying math enhances logical thinking, but there is little evidence to support this claim. Many students learn math by rote memory, focusing on formulas without truly understanding the concepts behind them. This method often leaves them feeling disconnected from the subject. Instead of forcing students to learn math that they may never use, we should consider teaching them logic and reasoning skills, which are not only more engaging but also applicable in real-life situations. By shifting the focus to these essential skills, we can better prepare students for the challenges they will face outside of the classroom. Teachers need to do better!!!!!",

        "text": "My hot take on the Halloween franchise is that every iteration/reboot is doomed to fail for one reason: They constantly call him Michael. In the original script for the movie, he was only ever referred to as The Shape. The idea being that he is the incarnation of pure evil which only takes the shape of a man. But the movies insist on reminding us that he\u2019s just a little boy who went crazy one night and has a very human story of living in a mental hospital for 15 years before escaping. The characters in the movie all know his story and they act like he is a human that can simply be killed by normal means. This becomes a problem in the later films because eventually they run out of ways to plausibly have him defeated without being killed, like that terrible twist where he\u2019s hit by a truck and then it\u2019s revealed in the next movie that he switched places with some random jagoff beforehand. In Halloween Ends they just slit his throat and kill him and\u2026 that\u2019s it. This guy who has been unkillable for 40 something years is just\u2026 killed. The Halloween films should lean into the parts that make you wonder: is this really a man, or is this a supernatural being? Without ever giving a definitive answer. When The Shape is shot 6 times in the chest and falls out of a window, only to be nowhere in sight just a moment later, that is scary. That is Halloween. When he\u2019s standing in the kitchen with his fingers freshly blown off by a shotgun, showing no sign of pain and listening for Laurie to make a sound in her bunker, that is Halloween. The boogeyman should not have a name. He should only be referred to as The Shape, or The Boogeyman, or \u201cit\u201d, not \u201che\u201d. The characters must believe they are being hunted by pure evil, rather than a man. They shouldn\u2019t even think about trying to fight him until they\u2019re completely cornered. Calling him Michael humanizes him and ruins the fear factor.\n\nMy even hotter take is that the only way to make another good Halloween film after the 3rd strikeout is to make a reboot in which Michael Myers is the original victim of The Shape on that fateful Halloween night. Imagine we see Michael and Judith both killed in their home by a man we never see clearly. Their parents come home to find their children\u2019s bodies posed outside like Halloween decorations. With no witnesses and no suspects, the town creates a myth about the boogeyman who killed little Michael Myers on Halloween night.\n\nPeople will probably hate it because they're so attached to the idea that Michael Myers is the killer and it cant be any other way, but I think it's a necessary step in detaching the humanity from the boogeyman.",

But saying please let's them know you really need and expect it.

I know they like my cat, so it's not completely out of left field. But they have a dog and also work, so I wouldn't want them to feel obligated to. Therefore, I just asked politely without a please.

        "text": "Every sport has a ton of fans complaining about the officials after practically every game, but I think NBA might be the worst. Go into any game thread and its like 50% whining about refs, and if you asked most NBA fans what they think of the officiating they'd probably say it sucks.\n\nFrankly, I think this is a result of totally unrealistic expectations, and that NBA refs (for the most part, there are some bad ones and of course the whole Donaghy scandal, but I'm talking on average) do a decent job at what is an almost impossible job to do well.\n\n**Basketball is the toughest sport to officiate, by far.** Its faster paced than football and there's far more to keep track of for each official than in baseball, and the very nature of the sport is that on almost every single play, there will be contact that could, if you decided to be an absolute stickler, be called as a foul. But of course if you did call all contact the game would become an unwatchable slog. So the job isn't actually \"call everything that technically qualifies as a foul\", its \"make subjective judgement calls on every play as to what qualifies *enough* as a foul.\" That pretty much guarantees a dynamic wherein fans of one team or another will constantly have reasons to complain, because they'll always be able to point to some level of contact against their team that wasn't called, or calls against their team that don't really like any worse than contact by the other team that wasn't called.   \n  \nThe perfect example of this was Shaq\u2014on practically every play, the guy defending him would have contact that could arguably be a foul, and then Shaq would elbow him out of the way, which could also arguably be a foul. Lakers fans would point to the contact against him and say it should have been called, while fans of the other team would say Shaq should have been called for the offensive foul. Calling everything would slow the game down way too much, calling nothing means physicality escalates until the game devolves into a borderline brawl. There's no real winning, no way to call it \"correctly\" in such a way that everyone is happy. \n\nShaq is perhaps the most extreme example, but versions of this same dynamic probably play out dozens of times in an average game, at an incredibly fast pace that requires the refs to be keeping track of a million things at once. It is an *extremely* difficult job, and expecting anyone to get it right 100% of the time is absolutely not realistic or reasonable.\n\n**If you want to see what actually bad basketball officiating looks like, you can very easily\u2014watch pretty much any other organized, televised basketball game.** WNBA, for example, just finished up a great finals marred by genuinely awful calls in crucial moments. NCAA and even FIBA also have baffling calls at a higher rate than NBA. \n\nImperfection and subjectivity are fundamentally baked into officiating basketball, and all things considered most NBA refs do a better job than most non-NBA refs.\n\n",

They\u2019re monotone and stuck on a single octave. They sound so bored recording the song. As comical as the forced emotion in Disturbed\u2019s can be, at least there IS emotion.

        "text": "I frequently hear people complaining about how digital games are so bad because we don\u2019t own anything anymore, no aftermarket etc. while I somewhat agree, the pros vastly outweigh the cons. \n\nI first really felt this last night when I went to play bo: Cold War which I have on disc. I forgot that discs stopped being plug and play, it has to copy the game the ssd because discs are too slow now. \n\n1. Speed\nThat became extra apparent when it simultaneously copied 56gb from the disc and downloaded a 157gb update. (Popular opinion, Cod takes up way too much space) the crazy part is, the update finished downloading before the disc finished copying\u2026 I didn\u2019t realize how outdated the transfer speeds are compared to modern WiFi. \n\n2. Convenience \nBeing able to buy the game on an app and have it download to your console while you\u2019re still at work so that it\u2019s already ready for you is so great. While I\u2019m nostalgic about GameStop, the act of buying a game, getting super hyped reading the box on the way home, and then popping it in to wait for a 2hr install/update was an emotional rollercoaster that I\u2019ll happily give up my GameStop trip for. \n\n3. Never break a disc\nI think people have quickly forgotten how much it sucks to ruin a disc, and then you\u2019re just sol, go buy another copy. \n\n4. Indie games\nBecause of how much cheaper it is to distribute games, the indie world has thrived and is now competing and beating AAA titles fairly regularly. This would\u2019ve never happened if physical media remained the norm. \n\n\nAnyways, I get the nostalgia, I have it too, but let\u2019s remember what wasn\u2019t so great about discs as well. Digital is a far superior medium. Is saving $20-40 on a used game that doesn\u2019t even go to the publisher who made it really worth all this headache? Plus now there\u2019s g2a etc. if you really need to save some money. ",

Moreover, Si-Ca anodes can swell by up to 400% during charging, while, Li-ion batteries typically experience a swelling of about 7% over their lifespan.

The sample reveals the cat also has a UTI, and it'll be another $100 for the antibiotic shot. \n\nNow the cat is feeling much better but suddenly started breathing heavily. I'm hoping it's a stuffy nose or a reaction to the medicine. \n\nI love this cat and all pets. At the same time my aunt rents alone and is asking family members for help with the vet bills. \n\nShe does not have the thousand it's already required nevermind the cost of future problems.

When you break it down, a $60 game can easily get you hundreds, even thousands of hours of entertainment if it\u2019s something you enjoy and play regularly. That\u2019s literally cents per hour, and in some cases even less.\n\nNow compare that to seeing a movie or going out for dinner. A two-hour movie is going to cost, what, $15+ a ticket? More if you get snacks. Same for a dinner out \u2014 easily $30 for one meal that\u2019s over in an hour or two. Meanwhile, you could grab an indie game on sale for under $10 and get dozens of hours out of it.\n\nPeople complain about the price of consoles and gaming PCs, but if you look at the hours people spend gaming over the years, it\u2019s still so much cheaper than shelling out for constant new movies, concerts, dinners, or even subscriptions to a bunch of streaming services. You don\u2019t have to keep paying for gear, entry fees, or even travel costs like you would for other hobbies. And with things like quality free-to-play games, you\u2019re not even stuck paying full price most of the time. If you\u2019re smart about it, gaming is honestly one of the cheapest ways to get quality entertainment and can even be a social experience if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for.\n\nGaming doesn\u2019t just compete on time vs. cost either. Most games have way more replay value than movies or shows. And let\u2019s be real, even with the games-as-a-service model, a lot of us only buy games occasionally, especially with all the sales.",

Or better yet, they\u2019ll promise to propose and string you along for 5 years and then break up. If they know they have to wait for a few years to have sex, these impatient types will usually back out. \n\n2. It lowers your chances of getting an STD. Yes, it won\u2019t be a zero chance but your odds are better at staying STD free if you only focus on people who are willing to wait. \n\n3. It lowers the chance of pregnancy with someone who isn\u2019t committed to you enough to raise your children. \n\n4. Knowing each other first and really vibing is more important than sexual compatibility in a marriage. Due to mental or physical health, one of you could be unable to have sex. If you don\u2019t have that foundation built up, the marriage can end. \n\nObviously I\u2019m in favor of people making their own decisions. The purpose of this post isn\u2019t to condemn.

I won\u2019t name names but it\u2019s a channel that uses puppets and dark/inappropriate jokes. I assume his parents let him watch that because we gave it a try and within 2 minutes of the video, there was talk about s#*.\n\nMy mother turned it off and made him watch a more appropriate show. We got him to watch Barney, Bob the builder, and more other kid shows I grew up watching. He loved them. It should be noted that when he first got here, he expected everything to go his way, he thought he was the boss, and he thought he could cuss. We didn\u2019t even have to punish him. We just sat with him while he watched TV and moderated what he watched. \n\nSo many parents complain about there not being any good shows for kids anymore. Quit trying to look for new shows and show them the ones you grew up with. Quit trying to get other shows/content taken down because you find it inappropriate for your kid.

The best callout to this was in Tomorrow Never Dies, where the journalist mogul discovers he's not only a spy, but he's also a former partner of his wife and his solution was... kill his wife. Bond should've died by gunshot wound to the head the first night in Dr. No when he decided to tell everyone his name was \"Bond, James Bond,\" but for the sake of movie magic, this man has survived literally telling the bad guy his name and position within the British government directly.\n\nI'm glad they killed him in No Time To Die.

Thanks comments!\n\nJust to be clear:\n\nI am not against sympathy. \n\nI am not against showing sympathy to others.\n\nI consider myself to be quite the empath.\n\nEverything below just applies to me. If someone likes the following (or if the majority of humanity does), then by all means do it. This is just stating my belief.\n\nBut I HATE it when people show sympathy towards me without doing anything else. If it's something like, \"You're not alone and I'm here for you,\" I'm not mad because it has two components: sympathy and a promise to be there for them.\n\nImagine someone who took apart their microwave, all the pieces and parts on the table, and someone passes by and says, \"You're not alone\" or \"I'm so sorry you're in that situation\" or \"I'm so sorry you're going through this\". Uh...yeah??? All the pieces and parts are still on the counter, waiting to be put together. Imagine how ridiculous that would be. What would you do in that situation? Watch a video about it. If you don't know, pool together resources to help yourself know what to do. Don't just say, \"I'm so sorry you're going through this\" and move on with your life. If you're going to do that, just ignore the problem and move on with your life (which there's no shame in doing, by the way).\n\nIf someone doesn't know what to do to fix something, in my opinion, they should just admit it. \"I don't know how to help you. How can I help you?\" speaks VOLUMES compared to \"I'm so sorry you're in that situation\" and that's it, bye. (Or, y'know. Actually helping/researching how to help and then helping.)\n\nWhat's worse is when people say things as simple as \"I'm so sorry you're in that situation\" and then get viewed by others as \"oh, they're so empathetic/loving/kind\" without doing anything. It's just seven little words and all of a sudden they get elevated to God-like status to automatically make others like them. I know it's just basic manipulation, but it makes me sick.\n\nJust wanted to vent because things in my life have popped up to where I'm seeing this sort of thing more often.\n\nAlso, a bit about \"You're not alone\": I can say it to others and if they like it that's all well and good. It's just that I don't like it when it's said to me. Yes, I have Google. I can Google that, for example, specifically 1 in 3 people in my country have the exact same problem as I do. It's not hard to confirm that, yes, I am indeed not alone. But what are you actually going to do to help me?",

The definition of civility, while remaining fixed in dictionaries, is an ever-evolving aspect of social behavior/expectations. Fifty years ago, saying Bob is an asshole might just get you ostracized from the workplace, but now? If Bob is an asshole, he\u2019s an asshole; there\u2019s nothing to be done about it but set that fact on the shelf and get on with your life. However, if you\u2019re telling Sally that Bob is an asshole, and Bob happens to walk up and hear the conversation, you shouldn\u2019t hem and haw and try to soften the blow. Just tell Bob that, yes, I think you\u2019re an asshole, and here\u2019s why: X, Y, and Z. If Bob is an asshole, he needs to be made aware of this. He may be blissfully unaware of this fact, and if so, you\u2019d be doing him a favor by openly sharing this opinion. Maybe Bob needs to change the way he does things; maybe Bob needs to change the way he talks to people.\n\nBut, then again, maybe Bob is just an asshole. If this is the case, again, the fact needs to be brought out, dusted off, and set on the shelf, so everyone can observe it and get on with their lives.\n\nWhatever you do or how you do it, backtracking for the sake of civility makes you appear weak (perhaps timid is slightly more accurate, but we\u2019ll go with weak for the sake of clarity), and potentially sets you up for even more of Asshole Bob\u2019s antics. Everybody is entitled to be treated like a human being, and if Bob can\u2019t handle that, then Bob can take a flying fuck at a rolling doughnut.

        "text": "Home ownership is overrated, expensive, stressful, and risky. Many things can go wrong with a house, i.e. death by a thousand paper cuts with all the maintenance needed, market downturns, natural disasters, etc. Unexpected costs add a tremendous amount of stress in life. Also, the time commitment to maintain a house constrains life. Home ownership decreases flexibility and opportunities because it's an illiquid asset and very expensive to sell, rebuy, and move. It makes it much harder to move to a different city and enjoy a different side of life, or pursue a different job opportunity. Investing the difference paid in rent in the S&P500, and the total cost to own a home including the opportunity cost of the downpayment, will more often than not make a person wealthier in the long run (there are exceptions of course). With that, the invested funds will be more liquid/flexible, and will allow a person to have a more varied and fruitful life because they'll actually be able to spend their net worth for travel, hobbies, etc. A house is a trade in life, that means higher costs, less disposable income, and less funds available to go out and see the world.\n\nThe biggest benefit of a house, from a financial perspective, is that it forces irresponsible people to save money. \n\nEdit: Of course, the biggest caveat, is that houses are more than just money. They can bring people joy to have a space that\u2019s truly theirs. Is this worth the other trade offs described above? I\u2019m not sure. ",

        "text": "I'm so tired of this. Companies (and even content creator merch) patting themselves on the back because they're planting one tree per purchase. \n\nNo, that's not sustainable - nor is it ethical. \n\nI actually work in the environment sector and there are a few things I want to mention: \n\n1. They're typically planted for cheap and then often not looked after. Most trees, with care, will survive past 7 years about 80% of the time. However, profit margins being profit margins, it's doubtful the company is spending enough to make sure the trees survive. Most companies only pay to get them planted - not for the aftercare. Because it sounds better to say they planted *x* many trees (as a total) and not that they've established a woodland of *y* size (which is undoubtedly less). \n\n2. Depending on who they're planting with, the third-party *may* be incentivised to make sure not too many survive -- that way they always have land to plant on. There are lots of companies that don't care enough to research what the success rate is like. \n\n3. One tree will not offset anywhere near enough carbon for the product you're producing. Without getting into too much of the production chain (and any supply chains that supplement it), just imagine the sheer amount of carbon it takes to power the creation of raw materials, collecting raw materials, processing raw materials, shipping the first stage, processing that and creating the final product (if there aren't any other materials or steps), shipping that product to the warehouse (overseas?) and then shipping it from the warehouse to the final destination. It's a truly staggering amount. One tree, especially a sapling, is not offsetting that. Not at all. For reference, a mature common oak (quercus robur) sequesters about 12kg of carbon per year - at maturity (it takes about 20-40 years for any tree to reach maturity, on average). \n\nIf you're going to plant trees, tell me how many have survived. Give me a calculator so I can see how much you're estimating the production/shipping carbon cost to be and how much your woodland is offsetting per year. \n\nFinally, I just want to say - lots of companies stop thinking at the carbon cost, but the human cost is also very important. Too many companies (and content creators, again) are focused too much on their profits that they don't bother ensuring their hoodies and plushes and whatnot are produced in an ethical environment with fair pay. \n\n'But they don't earn enough to pay for something as extensive as that' \n\nDont' care. They shouldn't bother. Or at least have the balls to be honest about it. \n\nOne company I see come up a fair bit (especially for merch sites) is JuniperCreates based in Canada. \n\nThey say they have planted just over 1 million trees and haved 'reduced' (whatever that's supposed to mean) over 300,000 tonnes of carbon. Assuming they mean sequester and assuming those are metric tonnes, that can't possibly be correct as it'd take 1 million trees about 40 years to sequester that amount of carbon. Especially because you'd hope they're planting trees properly - and not just producing a monoculture forest in regimented lines (which was/is very common as it was a practice adopted from lumber producers), which would make for an incredibly poor ecosystem.",

If someone stops loving you it can happen gradually, from multiple things that might on their own be insignificant building up until the person no longer loves you.  Also if it does happen in an instant it\u2019s often not over some more minor thing but over something more major.  A child probably won\u2019t stop loving their parent because they didn\u2019t read their favorite bedtime story but if the parent abuses the child then the child might go from once loving their parents to not loving their parents.  Similarly if you do one little thing that bothers a romantic partner they probably won\u2019t immediately fall out of love, but if your partner over time notices that you aren\u2019t compatible with them they might lose love over time.

It\u2019s exhausting, and honestly, it\u2019s just making gifts feel less meaningful.\n\nHalf the time, these gifts end up being random stuff people don\u2019t even want or need, just because we\u2019re expected to bring *something.* And when everyone\u2019s constantly giving and receiving, it turns into this cycle where you\u2019re spending money on things out of obligation rather than actual thoughtfulness.\n\nWouldn\u2019t it be better if we saved gifts for when we truly want to celebrate someone, instead of feeling like we have to buy something every time we get invited somewhere? I think cutting back would make gifts feel more special and way less like a chore.",

Sure, separating the types helps to understand where each person is stronger and provides a good starting point, but using this as an excuse to ignore everything else is pathetic. The worst part? When people use this classification to boost their own ego. The \u201cself-proclaimed geniuses,\u201d you know, the type that loves to claim they\u2019re an expert in one thing and that nothing else matters.

It gives teams that do this the advantage of having that many more plays on the goal line. Kicking an extra point is dumb when you can get two and I don't know why it's not done more. \n\nLike if the Lions decided that from the first game of the year, they'll always go for two points. Are you telling me that they wouldn't have a net positive point differential? You know they would and I don't know why its just not a normal thing and that it always seems that they're leaving a point on the field. \n\nSo yes, with every touchdown it should always be a two-point conversion, that should be the norm. Maybe there's times where you just need one point. Point that's a little bit more secure but especially early in the game, bro, Go for the two points.",

And the showers have these half glass/ half open setups so when you\u2019re done, there\u2019s water all over the floor, even if you put down the bath mat they provide (which is not big enough or durable for all that water). Oh and if you shower for more than 10 minutes, the entire bathroom is covered in condensation, so don\u2019t leave your phone or any hair styling tools in there. I know it\u2019s a silly thing to complain about, but why do so many hotels think this works. I would take a boring, conventional bathroom over an aesthetically pleasing one any day. ",

The 5s was the first phone to introduce touch ID and quite frankly I feel that the dang face ID we have nowadays is just too much. Yeah, I get it, face ID is easier but that doesn't beat the simplicity and effectiveness of touch ID. And also, not to get into conspiracy theories or anything but I do not trust apple to have my face ID data. \nTouch ID rules!!! \nFurthermore, not only were they really cool and handy in the hand, they were also very durable!! I remember my sister dropping the phone many times and the screen and back never broke or gave out. Shoot after years of the phone being put away, she took it out and used it and still worked like it did back in the day. Nowadays, the iPhones can be cheap and break super easily. \nThe iPhone 5s and c were the best phones that Apple has made. Everything they have nowadays seems to be a repeat and unfortunately I don't think we'll be getting another classic iPhone like the 5 series :(\n",

On the other hand, thousands if not millions of people walk by a vending machine each day. Yet, there are very little human encounters with sharks.\n\nAnimals like bears and sharks are already pretty rare in the wild, but additionally beaches and forest close down due to shark and bear activity respectively and if people see one they instantly run away. Undoubtedly humans interact way less with sharks than vending machines, causing vending machines to have a higher kill count per year. \n\nThe reason why the less dangerous thing kills more people is not because they are actually deadlier, but because way more people will go in close proximity to them while most people would run away from sharks, bears, lions, etc.  \n\nMosquitos though are genuinely just dangerous, homicidal little bastards.

However, there is a vague idea that curvy women in thong bikinis look vulgar, as if the choice is acceptable only for women with slim/fit shapes.\n\nSo that's it, obviously this issue is not a problem for us, but certainly thong bikinis are more appropriate for thicker bodies because they provide a better fit for this type of body.",

When you break it down, a $60 game can easily get you hundreds, even thousands of hours of entertainment if it\u2019s something you enjoy and play regularly. That\u2019s literally cents per hour, and in some cases even less.\n\nNow compare that to seeing a movie or going out for dinner. A two-hour movie is going to cost, what, $15+ a ticket? More if you get snacks. Same for a dinner out \u2014 easily $30 for one meal that\u2019s over in an hour or two. Meanwhile, you could grab an indie game on sale for under $10 and get dozens of hours out of it.\n\nPeople complain about the price of consoles and gaming PCs, but if you look at the hours people spend gaming over the years, it\u2019s still so much cheaper than shelling out for constant new movies, concerts, dinners, or even subscriptions to a bunch of streaming services. You don\u2019t have to keep paying for gear, entry fees, or even travel costs like you would for other hobbies. And with things like quality free-to-play games, you\u2019re not even stuck paying full price most of the time. If you\u2019re smart about it, gaming is honestly one of the cheapest ways to get quality entertainment and can even be a social experience if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for.\n\nGaming doesn\u2019t just compete on time vs. cost either. Most games have way more replay value than movies or shows. And let\u2019s be real, even with the games-as-a-service model, a lot of us only buy games occasionally, especially with all the sales.",

        "text": "I\u2019m a woman, and I feel this way because of a few reasons. I will only mention the secular reasons. \n\n1. It filters out men who just want sex without making a commitment. Some men (not all) will say anything to get you to sleep with them. They\u2019ll pretend to be the perfect bf and have great sex, but then disappear after they\u2019re bored. Or better yet, they\u2019ll promise to propose and string you along for 5 years and then break up. If they know they have to wait for a few years to have sex, these impatient types will usually back out. \n\n2. It lowers your chances of getting an STD. Yes, it won\u2019t be a zero chance but your odds are better at staying STD free if you only focus on people who are willing to wait. \n\n3. It lowers the chance of pregnancy with someone who isn\u2019t committed to you enough to raise your children. \n\n4. Knowing each other first and really vibing is more important than sexual compatibility in a marriage. Due to mental or physical health, one of you could be unable to have sex. If you don\u2019t have that foundation built up, the marriage can end. \n\nObviously I\u2019m in favor of people making their own decisions. The purpose of this post isn\u2019t to condemn. This is just my opinion of why waiting might benefit women specifically. ",

The mother wasn\u2019t exactly perfect, I won\u2019t get into it because we know them personally (the reason we got the kids in the first place) and she does try her best. \n\nWell when the kids first got here the 5 year old wanted to watch a YouTube channel. I won\u2019t name names but it\u2019s a channel that uses puppets and dark/inappropriate jokes. I assume his parents let him watch that because we gave it a try and within 2 minutes of the video, there was talk about s#*.\n\nMy mother turned it off and made him watch a more appropriate show. We got him to watch Barney, Bob the builder, and more other kid shows I grew up watching. He loved them. It should be noted that when he first got here, he expected everything to go his way, he thought he was the boss, and he thought he could cuss. We didn\u2019t even have to punish him. We just sat with him while he watched TV and moderated what he watched. \n\nSo many parents complain about there not being any good shows for kids anymore. Quit trying to look for new shows and show them the ones you grew up with. Quit trying to get other shows/content taken down because you find it inappropriate for your kid. If you don\u2019t want your kid to see it. don\u2019t let them.",

If it's something like, \"You're not alone and I'm here for you,\" I'm not mad because it has two components: sympathy and a promise to be there for them.\n\nImagine someone who took apart their microwave, all the pieces and parts on the table, and someone passes by and says, \"You're not alone\" or \"I'm so sorry you're in that situation\" or \"I'm so sorry you're going through this\". Uh...yeah??? All the pieces and parts are still on the counter, waiting to be put together. Imagine how ridiculous that would be. What would you do in that situation? Watch a video about it. If you don't know, pool together resources to help yourself know what to do. Don't just say, \"I'm so sorry you're going through this\" and move on with your life. If you're going to do that, just ignore the problem and move on with your life (which there's no shame in doing, by the way).\n\nIf someone doesn't know what to do to fix something, in my opinion, they should just admit it. \"I don't know how to help you. How can I help you?\" speaks VOLUMES compared to \"I'm so sorry you're in that situation\" and that's it, bye. (Or, y'know. Actually helping/researching how to help and then helping.)\n\nWhat's worse is when people say things as simple as \"I'm so sorry you're in that situation\" and then get viewed by others as \"oh, they're so empathetic/loving/kind\" without doing anything. It's just seven little words and all of a sudden they get elevated to God-like status to automatically make others like them. I know it's just basic manipulation, but it makes me sick.\n\nJust wanted to vent because things in my life have popped up to where I'm seeing this sort of thing more often.\n\nAlso, a bit about \"You're not alone\": I can say it to others and if they like it that's all well and good. It's just that I don't like it when it's said to me. Yes, I have Google. I can Google that, for example, specifically 1 in 3 people in my country have the exact same problem as I do. It's not hard to confirm that, yes, I am indeed not alone. But what are you actually going to do to help me?",

The definition of civility, while remaining fixed in dictionaries, is an ever-evolving aspect of social behavior/expectations. Fifty years ago, saying Bob is an asshole might just get you ostracized from the workplace, but now? If Bob is an asshole, he\u2019s an asshole; there\u2019s nothing to be done about it but set that fact on the shelf and get on with your life. However, if you\u2019re telling Sally that Bob is an asshole, and Bob happens to walk up and hear the conversation, you shouldn\u2019t hem and haw and try to soften the blow. Just tell Bob that, yes, I think you\u2019re an asshole, and here\u2019s why: X, Y, and Z. If Bob is an asshole, he needs to be made aware of this. He may be blissfully unaware of this fact, and if so, you\u2019d be doing him a favor by openly sharing this opinion. Maybe Bob needs to change the way he does things; maybe Bob needs to change the way he talks to people.\n\nBut, then again, maybe Bob is just an asshole. If this is the case, again, the fact needs to be brought out, dusted off, and set on the shelf, so everyone can observe it and get on with their lives.\n\nWhatever you do or how you do it, backtracking for the sake of civility makes you appear weak (perhaps timid is slightly more accurate, but we\u2019ll go with weak for the sake of clarity), and potentially sets you up for even more of Asshole Bob\u2019s antics. Everybody is entitled to be treated like a human being, and if Bob can\u2019t handle that, then Bob can take a flying fuck at a rolling doughnut. Own your opinion, stand up for yourself and, where applicable, for others. For the whole of society, if that\u2019s what it takes. Be strong, resolute, and never forget that you deserve to be treated like a human being, regardless of who you are, what you wear, who you love, where your interests lie, or anything else.\n\nJust don\u2019t be a Bob.",

Many things can go wrong with a house, i.e. death by a thousand paper cuts with all the maintenance needed, market downturns, natural disasters, etc. Unexpected costs add a tremendous amount of stress in life. Also, the time commitment to maintain a house constrains life. Home ownership decreases flexibility and opportunities because it's an illiquid asset and very expensive to sell, rebuy, and move. It makes it much harder to move to a different city and enjoy a different side of life, or pursue a different job opportunity. Investing the difference paid in rent in the S&P500, and the total cost to own a home including the opportunity cost of the downpayment, will more often than not make a person wealthier in the long run (there are exceptions of course). With that, the invested funds will be more liquid/flexible, and will allow a person to have a more varied and fruitful life because they'll actually be able to spend their net worth for travel, hobbies, etc. A house is a trade in life, that means higher costs, less disposable income, and less funds available to go out and see the world.\n\nThe biggest benefit of a house, from a financial perspective, is that it forces irresponsible people to save money. \n\nEdit: Of course, the biggest caveat, is that houses are more than just money. They can bring people joy to have a space that\u2019s truly theirs. Is this worth the other trade offs described above? I\u2019m not sure. ",

        "text": "I'm so tired of this. Companies (and even content creator merch) patting themselves on the back because they're planting one tree per purchase. \n\nNo, that's not sustainable - nor is it ethical. \n\nI actually work in the environment sector and there are a few things I want to mention: \n\n1. They're typically planted for cheap and then often not looked after. Most trees, with care, will survive past 7 years about 80% of the time. However, profit margins being profit margins, it's doubtful the company is spending enough to make sure the trees survive. Most companies only pay to get them planted - not for the aftercare. Because it sounds better to say they planted *x* many trees (as a total) and not that they've established a woodland of *y* size (which is undoubtedly less). \n\n2. Depending on who they're planting with, the third-party *may* be incentivised to make sure not too many survive -- that way they always have land to plant on. There are lots of companies that don't care enough to research what the success rate is like. \n\n3. One tree will not offset anywhere near enough carbon for the product you're producing. Without getting into too much of the production chain (and any supply chains that supplement it), just imagine the sheer amount of carbon it takes to power the creation of raw materials, collecting raw materials, processing raw materials, shipping the first stage, processing that and creating the final product (if there aren't any other materials or steps), shipping that product to the warehouse (overseas?) and then shipping it from the warehouse to the final destination. It's a truly staggering amount. One tree, especially a sapling, is not offsetting that. Not at all. For reference, a mature common oak (quercus robur) sequesters about 12kg of carbon per year - at maturity (it takes about 20-40 years for any tree to reach maturity, on average). \n\nIf you're going to plant trees, tell me how many have survived. Give me a calculator so I can see how much you're estimating the production/shipping carbon cost to be and how much your woodland is offsetting per year. \n\nFinally, I just want to say - lots of companies stop thinking at the carbon cost, but the human cost is also very important. Too many companies (and content creators, again) are focused too much on their profits that they don't bother ensuring their hoodies and plushes and whatnot are produced in an ethical environment with fair pay. \n\n'But they don't earn enough to pay for something as extensive as that' \n\nDont' care. They shouldn't bother. Or at least have the balls to be honest about it. \n\nOne company I see come up a fair bit (especially for merch sites) is JuniperCreates based in Canada. \n\nThey say they have planted just over 1 million trees and haved 'reduced' (whatever that's supposed to mean) over 300,000 tonnes of carbon. Assuming they mean sequester and assuming those are metric tonnes, that can't possibly be correct as it'd take 1 million trees about 40 years to sequester that amount of carbon. Especially because you'd hope they're planting trees properly - and not just producing a monoculture forest in regimented lines (which was/is very common as it was a practice adopted from lumber producers), which would make for an incredibly poor ecosystem.",

If someone stops loving you it can happen gradually, from multiple things that might on their own be insignificant building up until the person no longer loves you.  Also if it does happen in an instant it\u2019s often not over some more minor thing but over something more major.  A child probably won\u2019t stop loving their parent because they didn\u2019t read their favorite bedtime story but if the parent abuses the child then the child might go from once loving their parents to not loving their parents.  Similarly if you do one little thing that bothers a romantic partner they probably won\u2019t immediately fall out of love, but if your partner over time notices that you aren\u2019t compatible with them they might lose love over time.

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a problem for everyone, but for some I do really believe this can potentially create, as much as we hate to admit it, a power dynamic. \n\nPart of the problem is one that I don\u2019t see an easy solution to because men can seem inherently threatening or all about sex. I am speaking from personal experience so take it with a grain of salt, but it seems like every time I get on well with a women in an environment, rumours loom of infidelity or women lose interest in talking/hanging out as soon as they find out I have a partner (which is always soon after meeting someone). Inversely, my girlfriend makes new guy friends like it\u2019s nothing. \n\nGuys do not seem to care at all about being friendly to a woman if she has a partner. Some guys probably have their shady reasons and others probably just don\u2019t care, but my unpopular (I think) opinion is that guys don\u2019t have the same options for friendship across the gender spectrum and subsequently don\u2019t have as much balance in their lives.

It gives teams that do this the advantage of having that many more plays on the goal line. Kicking an extra point is dumb when you can get two and I don't know why it's not done more. \n\nLike if the Lions decided that from the first game of the year, they'll always go for two points. Are you telling me that they wouldn't have a net positive point differential? You know they would and I don't know why its just not a normal thing and that it always seems that they're leaving a point on the field. \n\nSo yes, with every touchdown it should always be a two-point conversion, that should be the norm.

I like going home to a place I know the rent has been paid, food has been covered, I have some time to unwind and relax, and also have a little left over for luxuries. I could do that for years and I wouldn't feel it necessary to strive for more, or at least until I get bored or it becomes an uncomfortable stagnation feeling. \n\nLarger goals can also lead to larger disappoints if they fail. I wouldn't trade my comfort zone if there's a chance I could lose it and be less comfortable and less at peace than before.

Yeah, I get it, face ID is easier but that doesn't beat the simplicity and effectiveness of touch ID. And also, not to get into conspiracy theories or anything but I do not trust apple to have my face ID data. \nTouch ID rules!!! \nFurthermore, not only were they really cool and handy in the hand, they were also very durable!! I remember my sister dropping the phone many times and the screen and back never broke or gave out. Shoot after years of the phone being put away, she took it out and used it and still worked like it did back in the day. Nowadays, the iPhones can be cheap and break super easily. \nThe iPhone 5s and c were the best phones that Apple has made.

Instead of revolving around a capitalistic system based on infinite growth with finite resources, we put our time and money towards betterment of the environment. So people working on reforestation, invasive species removal, etc. This would drastically improve the conditions of our remaining green space and provide thousands of jobs. Obviously there would still be other jobs to be had like working to make energy or the service industry but overall our society should revolve around the betterment of the earth since our survival depends on it.",

        "text": "As a child I wasn't a huge fan of Gambon as Dumbledore, but as an adult it's more annoying. I rewatched the movies and I couldn't stand Gambon's portrayal of Dumbledore.\n\nDumbledore is supposed to be a gentle, logical and caring individual, but Gambon made him to be a pompous and arrogant ass half the time. I know this has been pointed out a lot with 'DID YA PUT CHER NAME IN THE GOBLET OF FIYAH' memes, but the reality is he disregarded the source material and decided to make the character what he thought it should be rather than what he was supposed to be.\n\nIn my opinion, the ending of the movies >!where Harry relives Snape's memories in the Pensive paint him to be a cold, selfish individual who never really cared for Harry in my opinion, when the reality is Albus and Harry had a very close relationship and while Dumbledore was aware that Harry would have to die, he was far more remorseful about the reality than Gambon portrayed in the films. !<\n\nIt's a shame because the casting choices had otherwise been almost flawless. It felt like nearly every major character was casted perfectly for the character they were portraying, but Gambon ruined it. \n\n",

However, there is a vague idea that curvy women in thong bikinis look vulgar, as if the choice is acceptable only for women with slim/fit shapes.\n\nSo that's it, obviously this issue is not a problem for us, but certainly thong bikinis are more appropriate for thicker bodies because they provide a better fit for this type of body.",

        "text": "Look, I know people like to say gaming is an expensive hobby, but compared to most other forms of entertainment, it\u2019s actually a huge money-saver. When you break it down, a $60 game can easily get you hundreds, even thousands of hours of entertainment if it\u2019s something you enjoy and play regularly. That\u2019s literally cents per hour, and in some cases even less.\n\nNow compare that to seeing a movie or going out for dinner. A two-hour movie is going to cost, what, $15+ a ticket? More if you get snacks. Same for a dinner out \u2014 easily $30 for one meal that\u2019s over in an hour or two. Meanwhile, you could grab an indie game on sale for under $10 and get dozens of hours out of it.\n\nPeople complain about the price of consoles and gaming PCs, but if you look at the hours people spend gaming over the years, it\u2019s still so much cheaper than shelling out for constant new movies, concerts, dinners, or even subscriptions to a bunch of streaming services. You don\u2019t have to keep paying for gear, entry fees, or even travel costs like you would for other hobbies. And with things like quality free-to-play games, you\u2019re not even stuck paying full price most of the time. If you\u2019re smart about it, gaming is honestly one of the cheapest ways to get quality entertainment and can even be a social experience if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for.\n\nGaming doesn\u2019t just compete on time vs. cost either. Most games have way more replay value than movies or shows. And let\u2019s be real, even with the games-as-a-service model, a lot of us only buy games occasionally, especially with all the sales.",

Some men (not all) will say anything to get you to sleep with them. They\u2019ll pretend to be the perfect bf and have great sex, but then disappear after they\u2019re bored. Or better yet, they\u2019ll promise to propose and string you along for 5 years and then break up. If they know they have to wait for a few years to have sex, these impatient types will usually back out. \n\n2. It lowers your chances of getting an STD. Yes, it won\u2019t be a zero chance but your odds are better at staying STD free if you only focus on people who are willing to wait. \n\n3. It lowers the chance of pregnancy with someone who isn\u2019t committed to you enough to raise your children. \n\n4. Knowing each other first and really vibing is more important than sexual compatibility in a marriage. Due to mental or physical health, one of you could be unable to have sex. If you don\u2019t have that foundation built up, the marriage can end. \n\nObviously I\u2019m in favor of people making their own decisions. The purpose of this post isn\u2019t to condemn.

I won\u2019t name names but it\u2019s a channel that uses puppets and dark/inappropriate jokes. I assume his parents let him watch that because we gave it a try and within 2 minutes of the video, there was talk about s#*.\n\nMy mother turned it off and made him watch a more appropriate show. We got him to watch Barney, Bob the builder, and more other kid shows I grew up watching. He loved them. It should be noted that when he first got here, he expected everything to go his way, he thought he was the boss, and he thought he could cuss. We didn\u2019t even have to punish him. We just sat with him while he watched TV and moderated what he watched. \n\nSo many parents complain about there not being any good shows for kids anymore. Quit trying to look for new shows and show them the ones you grew up with. Quit trying to get other shows/content taken down because you find it inappropriate for your kid. If you don\u2019t want your kid to see it. don\u2019t let them.",

Thanks comments!\n\nJust to be clear:\n\nI am not against sympathy. \n\nI am not against showing sympathy to others.\n\nI consider myself to be quite the empath.\n\nEverything below just applies to me. If someone likes the following (or if the majority of humanity does), then by all means do it. This is just stating my belief.\n\nBut I HATE it when people show sympathy towards me without doing anything else. If it's something like, \"You're not alone and I'm here for you,\" I'm not mad because it has two components: sympathy and a promise to be there for them.\n\nImagine someone who took apart their microwave, all the pieces and parts on the table, and someone passes by and says, \"You're not alone\" or \"I'm so sorry you're in that situation\" or \"I'm so sorry you're going through this\". Uh...yeah??? All the pieces and parts are still on the counter, waiting to be put together. Imagine how ridiculous that would be. What would you do in that situation? Watch a video about it. If you don't know, pool together resources to help yourself know what to do. Don't just say, \"I'm so sorry you're going through this\" and move on with your life. If you're going to do that, just ignore the problem and move on with your life (which there's no shame in doing, by the way).\n\nIf someone doesn't know what to do to fix something, in my opinion, they should just admit it. \"I don't know how to help you. How can I help you?\" speaks VOLUMES compared to \"I'm so sorry you're in that situation\" and that's it, bye. (Or, y'know. Actually helping/researching how to help and then helping.)\n\nWhat's worse is when people say things as simple as \"I'm so sorry you're in that situation\" and then get viewed by others as \"oh, they're so empathetic/loving/kind\" without doing anything. It's just seven little words and all of a sudden they get elevated to God-like status to automatically make others like them. I know it's just basic manipulation, but it makes me sick.\n\nJust wanted to vent because things in my life have popped up to where I'm seeing this sort of thing more often.\n\nAlso, a bit about \"You're not alone\": I can say it to others and if they like it that's all well and good. It's just that I don't like it when it's said to me. Yes, I have Google. I can Google that, for example, specifically 1 in 3 people in my country have the exact same problem as I do. It's not hard to confirm that, yes, I am indeed not alone. But what are you actually going to do to help me?",

The definition of civility, while remaining fixed in dictionaries, is an ever-evolving aspect of social behavior/expectations. Fifty years ago, saying Bob is an asshole might just get you ostracized from the workplace, but now? If Bob is an asshole, he\u2019s an asshole; there\u2019s nothing to be done about it but set that fact on the shelf and get on with your life. However, if you\u2019re telling Sally that Bob is an asshole, and Bob happens to walk up and hear the conversation, you shouldn\u2019t hem and haw and try to soften the blow. Just tell Bob that, yes, I think you\u2019re an asshole, and here\u2019s why: X, Y, and Z. If Bob is an asshole, he needs to be made aware of this. He may be blissfully unaware of this fact, and if so, you\u2019d be doing him a favor by openly sharing this opinion. Maybe Bob needs to change the way he does things; maybe Bob needs to change the way he talks to people.\n\nBut, then again, maybe Bob is just an asshole. If this is the case, again, the fact needs to be brought out, dusted off, and set on the shelf, so everyone can observe it and get on with their lives.\n\nWhatever you do or how you do it, backtracking for the sake of civility makes you appear weak (perhaps timid is slightly more accurate, but we\u2019ll go with weak for the sake of clarity), and potentially sets you up for even more of Asshole Bob\u2019s antics. Everybody is entitled to be treated like a human being, and if Bob can\u2019t handle that, then Bob can take a flying fuck at a rolling doughnut. Own your opinion, stand up for yourself and, where applicable, for others. For the whole of society, if that\u2019s what it takes. Be strong, resolute, and never forget that you deserve to be treated like a human being, regardless of who you are, what you wear, who you love, where your interests lie, or anything else.\n\nJust don\u2019t be a Bob.",

Many things can go wrong with a house, i.e. death by a thousand paper cuts with all the maintenance needed, market downturns, natural disasters, etc. Unexpected costs add a tremendous amount of stress in life. Also, the time commitment to maintain a house constrains life. Home ownership decreases flexibility and opportunities because it's an illiquid asset and very expensive to sell, rebuy, and move. It makes it much harder to move to a different city and enjoy a different side of life, or pursue a different job opportunity. Investing the difference paid in rent in the S&P500, and the total cost to own a home including the opportunity cost of the downpayment, will more often than not make a person wealthier in the long run (there are exceptions of course). With that, the invested funds will be more liquid/flexible, and will allow a person to have a more varied and fruitful life because they'll actually be able to spend their net worth for travel, hobbies, etc. A house is a trade in life, that means higher costs, less disposable income, and less funds available to go out and see the world.\n\nThe biggest benefit of a house, from a financial perspective, is that it forces irresponsible people to save money. \n\nEdit: Of course, the biggest caveat, is that houses are more than just money. They can bring people joy to have a space that\u2019s truly theirs. Is this worth the other trade offs described above? I\u2019m not sure. ",

        "text": "I'm so tired of this. Companies (and even content creator merch) patting themselves on the back because they're planting one tree per purchase. \n\nNo, that's not sustainable - nor is it ethical. \n\nI actually work in the environment sector and there are a few things I want to mention: \n\n1. They're typically planted for cheap and then often not looked after. Most trees, with care, will survive past 7 years about 80% of the time. However, profit margins being profit margins, it's doubtful the company is spending enough to make sure the trees survive. Most companies only pay to get them planted - not for the aftercare. Because it sounds better to say they planted *x* many trees (as a total) and not that they've established a woodland of *y* size (which is undoubtedly less). \n\n2. Depending on who they're planting with, the third-party *may* be incentivised to make sure not too many survive -- that way they always have land to plant on. There are lots of companies that don't care enough to research what the success rate is like. \n\n3. One tree will not offset anywhere near enough carbon for the product you're producing. Without getting into too much of the production chain (and any supply chains that supplement it), just imagine the sheer amount of carbon it takes to power the creation of raw materials, collecting raw materials, processing raw materials, shipping the first stage, processing that and creating the final product (if there aren't any other materials or steps), shipping that product to the warehouse (overseas?) and then shipping it from the warehouse to the final destination. It's a truly staggering amount. One tree, especially a sapling, is not offsetting that. Not at all. For reference, a mature common oak (quercus robur) sequesters about 12kg of carbon per year - at maturity (it takes about 20-40 years for any tree to reach maturity, on average). \n\nIf you're going to plant trees, tell me how many have survived. Give me a calculator so I can see how much you're estimating the production/shipping carbon cost to be and how much your woodland is offsetting per year. \n\nFinally, I just want to say - lots of companies stop thinking at the carbon cost, but the human cost is also very important. Too many companies (and content creators, again) are focused too much on their profits that they don't bother ensuring their hoodies and plushes and whatnot are produced in an ethical environment with fair pay. \n\n'But they don't earn enough to pay for something as extensive as that' \n\nDont' care. They shouldn't bother. Or at least have the balls to be honest about it. \n\nOne company I see come up a fair bit (especially for merch sites) is JuniperCreates based in Canada. \n\nThey say they have planted just over 1 million trees and haved 'reduced' (whatever that's supposed to mean) over 300,000 tonnes of carbon. Assuming they mean sequester and assuming those are metric tonnes, that can't possibly be correct as it'd take 1 million trees about 40 years to sequester that amount of carbon. Especially because you'd hope they're planting trees properly - and not just producing a monoculture forest in regimented lines (which was/is very common as it was a practice adopted from lumber producers), which would make for an incredibly poor ecosystem.",

If someone stops loving you it can happen gradually, from multiple things that might on their own be insignificant building up until the person no longer loves you.  Also if it does happen in an instant it\u2019s often not over some more minor thing but over something more major.  A child probably won\u2019t stop loving their parent because they didn\u2019t read their favorite bedtime story but if the parent abuses the child then the child might go from once loving their parents to not loving their parents.  Similarly if you do one little thing that bothers a romantic partner they probably won\u2019t immediately fall out of love, but if your partner over time notices that you aren\u2019t compatible with them they might lose love over time.  If no longer loving someone one used to love didn\u2019t happen then it would be impossible to get over a breakup or even a crush.",

I am speaking from personal experience so take it with a grain of salt, but it seems like every time I get on well with a women in an environment, rumours loom of infidelity or women lose interest in talking/hanging out as soon as they find out I have a partner (which is always soon after meeting someone). Inversely, my girlfriend makes new guy friends like it\u2019s nothing. \n\nGuys do not seem to care at all about being friendly to a woman if she has a partner. Some guys probably have their shady reasons and others probably just don\u2019t care, but my unpopular (I think) opinion is that guys don\u2019t have the same options for friendship across the gender spectrum and subsequently don\u2019t have as much balance in their lives.

The strong, processed odor only adds to the off-putting experience, filling the room with a scent that lingers unpleasantly.

Yet, there are very little human encounters with sharks.\n\nAnimals like bears and sharks are already pretty rare in the wild, but additionally beaches and forest close down due to shark and bear activity respectively and if people see one they instantly run away. Undoubtedly humans interact way less with sharks than vending machines, causing vending machines to have a higher kill count per year. \n\nThe reason why the less dangerous thing kills more people is not because they are actually deadlier, but because way more people will go in close proximity to them while most people would run away from sharks, bears, lions, etc.  \n\nMosquitos though are genuinely just dangerous, homicidal little bastards.

These include birthdays.\n\nWhen I was young, I was suckered into the holiday spirit because it was impossible not to. School would put on holiday activities, colorful decorations were everywhere, etc.\n\nBut ever since becoming an adult, holiday activities have felt like nothing more than a burden. Putting up a Christmas tree and taking it down? A chore. Buying gifts for friends and relatives? A hassle. Receiving gifts from friends and relatives? Even worse; not only do I feel awful if my gifts are relatively subpar, but now I have another pile of stuff that I don't know what to do with. Plus, as time has passed, every time I receive a gift, I feel guilty because the other party spent their hard-earned money on me when they could've used that money for something better.\n\nSo you know what? No, I'm not coming to your holiday parties, and I won't host one of my own either. I won't buy you gifts, and I don't want you to give me any either. We can continue staying close by just being us and regularly keeping in touch rather than feel like we have to fulfill what we're expected to during holidays.",

The daily life decisions we take are biased by social norms, the desire to please the people around us, mind conditioning by social medias, culture and religion, worries about the next minute. If we closely observe each and every act in a day we can see that we are actually contained in a system that is designed to keep us down from reaching our full potential.\n\nHow many of us actually wakes up in the morning and feel happy to start their day? Truly enjoy ourselves and act ourselves. Can you wake up one day and just say \"f\\*ck off\" to all your worries and just do what you really want to do? We are contained by the fear of consequence and what it may leads to. \n\nMind conditioning by social media is the biggest prison. The algorithm shapes how we think and act. The attention we seek from the social media, comparison of ourselves with others, sharing a depressed state of mind etc. It doesn't allow us to free our mind to see for ourselves what we actually are worth. We just see what it wants us to see. You ever felt like you didn't like a song at first and after it pops up on your feed, you listen it to a million times and then you actually start to like it? If you did, it shows how your opinions and thinking are reshaped from the original one.\n\nThe education system tames our mind from the childhood itself. It teaches what they want us to learn, not what we need to learn. It doesn't teach how to make financial management, how to manage our emotions, basic life skills so and so. It teaches you how to be a worker. It just shows you a single path, get a job, work for 8hrs, stay secure. \n\nThere is no need for a physical wall to keep you contained if they can just imprison your mind. ",

It was a response to her sister just getting a brand new Honda CRV, a vehicle she couldn't afford, so a Kia had to do. She also confided in me how she hated the way it drove after just a few days. And that she was barely able to afford the Kia. Fast forward: today the streets are overcrowded with ugly, bulky, energy inefficient SUVs. Seems like everyone has a sister or a neighbor whom they have to copy or impress. No, not impress because owning an SUV today is the norm and who wants to be viewed as lesser than their sister or their neighbor?\n\nCan anyone with a straight face tell me that they actually need an SUV due to their circumstances? Is there that much more room in those ever growing monstrosities? They are less energy efficient, they are ugly, and they are often a pain to navigate around or park next to. Whatever happened to aesthetics? A car/sedan that's beautifully designed? Or even a hatchback if you feel the need for room? Our Golden retriever fits perfectly into our sedan as well as our 22 year old BMW station wagon. If you really have a large family, get a minivan.\n\nMaybe it's time that people realize that their tastes and preferences are not really defined by themselves but by popular opinion that surrounds and influences them. It's like you think you want something but in reality it's just a product of trends that are prevalent at any given time.\n\n ",

        "text": "So obviously, mm/dd/yyyy gets a lot of shit because it seems like random ordering. Im hoping to explain why this ordering is actually better. (As opposed to dd/mm/yyyy or yyyy/mm/dd)\n\n\nThe primary idea is relevancy and precision.\n\n\nTo start im going to argue for yyyy/mm/dd\n\n\nWhen reading, it is best to start with a wider scope, and slowly work towards more precision\n\n\nIf you read day first, it means very little without the bigger picture. So you dont gain any relevant info from reading it. Then you move onto the month. This again tells very little without knowing the year.\n\n\nAlternatively if you read the year first, you get the scope/context. You then narrow this down by learning the month which adds more precision to the information, then day which finishes it.\n\n\nIf this has not convinced you that yyyy/mm/dd is better than dd/mm/yyyy, i dont really know how else to convince you. For me it seems obvious that being provided context first makes learning details easier to absorb.\n\n\n......\n\n\nNOW, as mentioned, im arguing for the American date system.\n\n\nI maintain my above description, however --- for most common occurrences in ones life, the year isn't really that relevant. That is, outside history lessons one is mostly going to experience dates in the following contexts:\n\n\n- birthdays\n\n\n- holidays\n\n\n- appointments\n\n\nFor the first 2, these cyclical. The year isnt even relevant in the first place.\n\n\nWhen a data point is possibly absent, it makes the most sense to append it to the end. This way you dont have to go back and re-read once you realize data is missing.\n\n\nFurther, the third item I mention is appointments. 99% of the time, these are going to be within 11 months of when you make them. Thusly, you dont need to see the scope of the year, as this comes implicitly from the month (such that, if its December and you make an appointment in January, you are aware its going to be next year, not 11 months in the past).\n\n\n***thusly, in most common cases, the order of relevancy goes: month, day, year***\n\n\n..........\n\n\nHOWEVER\n\n\nI will concede each has its best contexts suited for it\n\n\nYyyy/mm/dd\n\n- history\n- release dates on games\n\n\nDd/mm/yyyy\n\n- ??\n- dates / meeting with friends? Kind of?\n- not really relevant, because if the day is the most important, then you ussually dont specify a number. That is, you might settup plans for \"next saturday\", not for \"16\"\n\n\nMm/dd/yyyy\n\n- appointments\n- holidays\n- other cyclical events (birthdays, anniversaries, etc)\n\n\n\nThe bottom line is that the easiest way to read is to get the most important/relevant data first. To get a sense of scope. Most of the time the most relevant bit of information is the month. Thusly it makes the most sense to do mm/dd/yyyy\n\n\n\n\nTLDR:\n\n\nPrioritize data in order of necessity to understand further data\n\n\nYear is often not relevant to dates you need to know in daily life.\n\n\nMonth gives proper context to understand what it means when you learn the day.\n\n\n.....\n\n\nOf note:\n\n\nI am not one to defend American systems often. I believe its stupid to adhere to things simply because they exist in the place you were born. This isnt a matter of defending America. This is a matter of defending a system which i actually believe to be the most logical, but gets shit on because people would rather sort by size than sort by relevance\n\n\nAlso for that matter. Mm/dd/yyyy is also better than yyyy/mm/dd because it makes it easier to sort the files by year. Specifically when files need to have an attached date that doesnt neccesarily correspond with the date it was entered.",

On first down Marshawn ran for 4 yards and the Seahawks let the clock run down to 26 seconds (in order to avoid a Patriots comeback). With 26 seconds from the one yard line that meant the Seahawks had THREE plays to punch it in \u2013 but only if one of those first two plays was a pass play.\u00a0 There probably was not time for three Beast Mode runs before time expired. The could pass on 2^(nd) (which they did) or 3^(rd), but there had to be a pass play somewhere.\u00a0 \n\nRussell Wilson had the responsibility of making sure only two catastrophic things did not happen on that pass play: a sack or an interception. If anything looked questionable his job was to toss it out of bounds for an incomplete pass that would stop the clock \u2013 and the Seahawks would still have time for two good Marshawn runs. \u00a0But Wilson threw it into tight coverage, Malcom Butler intercepted, the Patriots win again and everyone looked at Pete Carroll as the goat. \u00a0\u00a0But it was #3 Wilson who had the ball in his hands and instead of throwing it away tries to be the hero.",

I'm not versed in music composition or terminology at all, all I know is that I like a couple more than their original recordings.\n\nThe two standout examples for me are Ziggy Stardust by David Bowie and The Trooper by Iron Maiden.\n\nFor Ziggy Stardust, it's probably just because of the solo added towards the end, I think it's a really neat addition to the song, not too much or too little and sounds right at home on the track. I think the original (obviously) has better vocals but I just cannot get enough of the cover's instrumental.

The instruments are so close to the original that I'll almost always favor the cover as opposed to Ziggy which I'll pop on depending on which I prefer.

        "text": "My potentially unpopular opinion: white chocolate Reese\u2019s peanut butter cups are so much better than milk chocolate Reese\u2019s peanut butter cups. \n\nMy primary complaints with the milk chocolate cups can mostly be attributed to the chocolate. For one, the milk chocolate cups use a similar formula to Hershey\u2019s, and as such, you end up with that vile vomit-like aftertaste. Secondly, with the milk chocolate cups, I strangely find myself wanting to get past the chocolate, just to get to the peanut butter. It\u2019s almost as if I have to subconsciously force the chocolate down, and gaining access to the peanut butter filling is the prize for doing so. If I am buying a product, ideally, I would like to enjoy it in its entirety, not in part. It is for these reasons that I have never been a huge fan of the original milk chocolate cups.\n\nHowever, as it pertains to the Reese\u2019s white chocolate cups, none of these previously mentioned problems present themselves. The white chocolate is creamy, and melts very nicely in your mouth. Additionally, it does not leave an oily film in your mouth, unlike its milk chocolate counterpart. The white chocolate has a very pleasant vanilla flavor, which pairs deliciously with the magical Reese\u2019s peanut butter filling. I enjoy these white chocolate cups in their entirety, whereas with the milk chocolate cups, I cannot say the same.\n\nIn conclusion, based on my experiences with both products, I consider Reese\u2019s white chocolate peanut butter cups to be superior to the milk chocolate cups in every way. I\u2019m curious if anyone else shares this same opinion.",

        "text": "When I was young and first watched the movies, I never really found much interest in the Lord of the Ring trilogy, the would sometimes feel that the characters emotions and reactions were dull or overacted, and that a lot of situations just were somehow both too dramatic and too boring at the same time\n\nMost of the time I never felt the emotions of the characters, there was good acting and a good story, but I still never really felt anything for them. It didn\u2019t feel like they had much of any personalities or character development; Legolas was just always \u201cThe guy with the bow\u201d; Gimli was just always \u201cThe guy with the axe\u201d; etc.\n\nSpeaking of the characters, the one I dislike the most is Frodo. He\u2019s just not a good MC in my opinion, he carries the ring and that\u2019s about it, and he doesn\u2019t even destroy the ring in the end! He never does anything really heroic, he never does anything to deserve the admiration of everyone else\n\nSide note: Out of all the LOTR characters, Sam is my favorite, he is the real hero. Just a simple gardener, scared of asking out the live of his life, who goes on an adventure across the world, proving over and over again that he is worthy of the hero title. He actually has character development and challenges his fears and limits to help and protect his friends. Although I always found it a bit awkward that it seemed like Gandalf forced him to go with Frodo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nThe reasons why I prefer Hobbit is because a lot of the characters have emotions, good personalities and character development. I feel the sadness and passion of the dwarves, as well as their chemistry with each other. But to specify on the characters\n\nBilbo is a closed in loner, stuck in his little world and dreaming of going on an adventure but being prevented by his fear. He finds his bravery on the journey and becomes a truly valuable asset to the quest, so much so that he kills an orc saving Thorin\u2019s life, he tricks Gollum and makes it out of the Misty Mountains, he confronts a dragon for the sake of his friends, and in the end he betrays Thorin to save him\n\nThorin is a strong leader who cares for his brethren, but his judgment is clouded by his hatred towards elves and his arrogance, believing that he knows better than others around him. He dislikes Bilbo and thinks that he will become a liability, but learns that looks are deceiving and later sees Bilbo as a true friend. Along the journey, he makes bad decisions as well as good ones, and gives his life to finally stop the terror of his people\n\nThranduill is an arrogant man, who believes that the elves stand above all else because they\u2019re immortal. And Legolas (who is much better in this trilogy) is the same as his father, until he realizes that he is also mortal, he can bleed and he can die, and in difference form his father, he changes his ways and travel out into the world to find his own path in life. \n\nAnd then we have Smaug, who is not only one of my favorite dragons in fiction, but one of my favorite villains overall. The idea of a talking dragon is already off putting, you never really expect that to be cool, but his personality is so entertaining (it also helps that he is voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch). I love to hear him speak, both due to how calm he usually speaks, but also due to his elegant vocabulary. He is a fierce beast, but he\u2019s also a creature who thinks of himself and acts as a man of high nobility. He sees himself as a king or even a god, knowing that he can turn everything to ash in an instant, he doesn\u2019t keep his guard up, he truly thinks he is immortal, and his foolishness gets the best of him in the end\n\nThere are definitely bad characters or characters that are not as interesting, but the characters in the Hobbit are so much more interesting than the ones in LOTR in my opinion",

        "text": "Why aren't we getting more games like Incredible Crisis (PS1), Mr. Bones (Saturn), or Cubivore (GameCube) from major publishers? It seems like all the creativity has moved into the indie scene and the AAA market is full of marquee franchises full of monetization schemes. It's actually everyone's fault, though: \n\nDevelopers need to figure out why their size has grown so much. With the quality of game development tools nowadays, making games should take less people, not more. Or at least break even with the amount of detail games have nowadays. But during the ps2 era, a \"large development team\" was anything slightly larger that 100 people. Nowadays, literal battalions of people from all around the world work on a single game. That needs to stop. Break up your people into smaller groups and have them all work on different games, even if it takes longer. The value one person can add to the development process isn't nearly as much as the cost to hire them. That doesn't mean that you should hire the bare minimum. Instead you should have smaller teams with just enough people necessary for comfortably working on different games, if you insist on having a large work force. Because the other issue is you shouldn't be constantly one or two development projects away from bankruptcy. It's fine to take slightly longer to develop a game if you're also developing others simultaneously in an efficient manner. No one likes hearing that a beloved studio shut down because their latest game wasn't a runaway success. \n\nSpeaking of, publishers need to stop throwing pallets of money at the development of single games. You're not marvel. You can't really afford the game to fail. But \"failure\" is relative. In previous generations, a game could be considered moderately successful if it sold more than 500k copies. Very successful if it sold over a million. The original RE4, a game with a notoriously troubled development, was made in 2005 for about 20 million (30 million today). Over the years, it went on to sell over 12 million copies on multiple consoles. That's not something that would happen nowadays, when plans for ports would likely be canceled due to the \"measly\" 1.2 million copies originally on the GameCube. Then again, that many copies would only be considered a commercial failure nowadays because publishers regularly spend over 100 million in development costs alone. Never mind marketing. Maybe don't do that? \n\nLastly, and like it or leave it, games really are too cheap nowadays. A retail copy of Zelda: A Link to the Past would have cost you $50 when it released back in 1992. That's over $100 today. I'm not saying games should cost twice as much today. But if you want to get rid of monetization schemes that are always in your face, the price of games needs to go up. Not to mention that the price of AAA games sets the expectation for the prices of indie games. The lower the price of AAA games, the lower people expect the price of indie games to be. Indie developers work much harder, for much longer. They deserve to be properly rewarded for their effort. And lastly, there shouldn't be an expectation from gamers of developers -especially not indie developers- supporting their games for years and years for anything that isn't horribly broken. Anything beyond that, like small free add-ons and patches for very minor things, should be considered a gift and a thank you from them for playing their game. It shouldn't be the default expectation.

        "text": "Hi, first time poster but excited to post.\n\nI saw a clip of people comparing the loading times from Sparking Zero on the Ps5 to Tenkaichi 3 on the Ps2 and how they\u2019re almost identical loading times from booting up to starting a local.\n\nI, in the grand scheme of things, am not that old. I just turned twenty-four a month ago yet I\u2019ve been playing games for a very long time. \n\nThe first game I ever played was Yu-Gi-Oh: Duelist of the Roses on the Ps2 but I digress. \n\nAs the years have gone on, and technology has advanced, the loading screen is becoming somewhat of an anomaly; people do not want to wait for their games to load, but games still need to load, so they either make them as quick as possible or hide them in the game subtly (think Batman Arkham City or Resident Evil 7 wall-crawling sections). \n\nThis is understandable as, to be fair, no one likes to wait but as a kid, growing up in the early 2000s, there felt like there was an appeal to the loading screen. \n\nSome of this is, more than likely, a combination of childhood nostalgia and child-like naivety but loading screens taught some important lessons in patience, got the imagination going, and creating some interesting memorable \u201ckid\u201d moments. \n\nFor example, although some games had mini-games throughout their loading screens, most games had a little symbol or something going on on the screen to indicate to you the level is loading. This could sometimes go on for a lot longer than you\u2019d like; discs got scratched, discs got dirty, sometimes disks just wouldn\u2019t want to work. You, as a young wee lad, lack patience, you probably don\u2019t even understand the word yet, so you get antsy. You start pacing. You probably, like me, started talking to the console. \n\nYou reach a point where you find your little kid brain trying to reason why it\u2019s taking so long to load, that is very important long-term imo, whether that be sitting there counting each rotation because you, got whatever reason, believe each spin means 1% loaded.\n\nYou may have reached a point where you start threatening or trying to intimidate the inanimate piece of bolts: \u201clook, if you don\u2019t load in the next 30 seconds I\u2019m going to turn you off and NOT turn you on again\u201d.\n\nYou may have started looking away because, like a pot of water waiting to boil, it wouldn\u2019t work if you look at it. \n\nWhatever it is, the way you engaged with that boredom is important for growth. \n\nI, more than likely, am overthinking this. I also think some people may think this way as well. ",

Those bathrooms with pink, turquoise or mint tiles and porcelain are outdated and ugly, and the kitchens had the weirdest cabinet layouts.

If we can track what is done with the money, we can see what it's being used for in that moment,\n- there's an argument about somewhat of a big brother apocalyptic technology that tracks everything and that this is not productive to freedom. Freedom arguably does have consequences that are very bad. Let's take silk road and the dark web. \n- confiscation by the state is one things that the most negative about cashless society which is a reasonable threat , but they(reserve) act as a network security for money being taken from you. Eg) think of the instances of gold rush or having some form of physical cash before the advent of telecomms. If it gets lost or they rob you then that done for. On an even larger scale let's think about a heist of physical money. The problem with cash is theft and misuse because of the \"freedom\" . This freedom is a double edged sword",

        "text": "I'm not saying that alternating cars is a bad idea, but the general idea of \"zipper merging\" is that you go to the end of your lane and merge with the one next to it. There's no way that slowing down to 5mph so that we can go 1:1 into a single lane is quicker than cars going 60mph, being told they need to merge at some point in the next mile, and then merging over when they can.\n\nFor example, on a 2 lane road with one lane blocked (we\u2019ll say a tree has fallen down), merging full speed at the last second could be a serious safety issue. People are forced to slow down to almost a stop, when they could've otherwise merged at their regular speed. I think it actually makes bottlenecks worse. In situations like a busy 1 lane highway exit, the traffic issues are compounded by last second merges as slowing or stopping to merge forces the 2nd lane over to also slow/stop unnecessarily.\n\nA claim I see often is that \"it prevents stop and go traffic\" - How? Both lanes are literally forced to stop, either to let another car in, or to go into a gap another car has created. It's ***literally*** stop-and-go.\n\nI always see people say \"when X criteria is right, zipper merging is great\", but it's always some criteria that's practically never going to happen. The only situation I think zipper merging at the last second works is if there are two lanes that merge just after an intersection (and not because it's more efficient, it just prevents the intersection from getting blocked), but in my experience, I've personally never seen that. All the merges I see happen are in the middle of highways.\n\nThe theory of zipper merging works in a vaccum, but that\u2019s about the only place. Mostly it\u2019s just an excuse for people to behave selfishly and pretend it\u2019s for the greater good.\n\n\\- For the record, I do merge the proper way but only because I've been told do it that way. I just don't believe it works.",

She is far from the best break dancer in the world and there's no real argument there, but she still got on the world stage and gave us what is probably the thing most people will remember about the 2024 Olympics years down the line.\n\nNotoriety shouldn't automatically equate to a positive reception, obviously. But I don't understand why she should have been met with the vitriol I've seen online. She did something she loved. She brought joy with her as she performed on a global stage and delivered it with such confidence. It was a silly goofy thing that probably wasnt Olympic grade but she somehow made it to that stage anyway and delivered a performance that will live forever in our collective zeitgeist.\n\nShe's been shamed and mocked now to the point where she's feeling like she has to retire. Maybe she didn't belong in the Olympics but that doesn't mean she didn't deliver one of the most iconic moments in the games while she was there. People has treated her like she's some kind of clown. I feel like she should be viewed more as a folk hero.",

How does it work if the character they\u2019re possessing gets drunk? Does the entity have to get drunk to keep the charade up? Surely that would alert their team mates that something weird is going on?\n\nIn action settings it\u2019s fine, it works if a character is quickly charmed or has an illusion cast upon them and suddenly thinks their friends are their enemies (Grog in Season 2 of Vox Machina with Craven Edge, Scarlet Witch in Avengers 2), but in any other setting it just seems like it would be found out wayyyy too quickly if everyone was friends.

If you're not sure whether a piece of information is vandalism or not you can see the article's edit history to compare revisions.\n\nIn my opinion, Wikipedia is actually one of the most reliable and credible sources out there, especially in a time where information on the internet is getting harder to trust. I believe students should be free - or perhaps even encouraged - to use it to aid their research!",
