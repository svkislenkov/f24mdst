remember that even though sub not intended be for validation posts or be echo chamber or give advice on how people should behave specific situations practice lot times so just as reminder offline people your real life will think youre asshole if you take last cookie when you know child behind you wants theyll think youre asshole if you dont stand up for elderly person on bus theyll think youre asshole if you dont go out for drinks with your coworkers once while theyll think youre asshole if you dont try be involved your childs life no matter how much support you pay theyll think youre asshole if you cant help out your brother with babysitting once while even if youre childfree theyll think youre asshole if you wear nothing but underwear your own home when your roommate has guests over theyll think youre asshole if you cant detour for minutes day carpool with coworker for week while his car shop internet has its own values thats fine but real world people who cant just go along get along most time people who dont want mildly inconvenience themselves help out people around them people who dont seem put any stock into idea collectivism people around them are going consider them be assholes so yeah i love this sub i love reading stories i find very interesting hear peoples opinions but i personally think that probably more than time people i know real life would disagree with subs judgement whos asshole given situation i dont know if disparity just because reddits demographics or because people with alternate perspectives see writing on board dont want get down voted oblivion so even if you get replies on reddit saying that youre totally right if everyone your real life thinks youre asshole well theres probably reason for that maybe this just me but i really wish we could have more discussion about if someone being asshole if theyre being inconsiderate or selfish even if they dont technically owe anyone anything or maybe you believe that people offline are wrong we should continue promote individualistic value system seen on reddit both on offline thats discussion worth having too edit thanks guys this very interesting discussion so far lol dont just downvote people who disagree with meyou engage them without being combative edit ive never seen this movie but its come my attention that there already exists this world excellent tldr youre not wrong
