        "original_selftext": "I am tired of seeing people online AND irl claiming that poc, specifically black people can't be racist. Racism isn't inherently just anti-black, it's discrimination and hate against any race. Hence why it's called \"racist\" and not \"anti-black\". The excuse I usually hear is \"systemic racism\" as if that's the only kind of racism. It's not. \n\nAlso, while I understand that usually racism is supposed to be against minorities, different parts of the world have different groups that are considered the minority. There's countries such as South Korea where white people ARE the minority and they do face discrimination for not being ethnically Korean.  \n\nI also feel there are a LOT of double standards. I've seen TikTok live streams saying things such as \"White people should feel HONORED to listen to poc problems.\", and while I understand the point is to raise awareness to the discrimination that many poc still face, the wording feels almost like they're trying to attack white people. It feels incredibly off and no, I should not feel \"honored\" to have to listen to anyone's issues when I have my own. And yes, this means that those people in turn do NOT have to care about my problems. \n\nAnother double standard I see is people applauding culture swapping only when it's changing a white character to a poc. I feel like culture swapping shouldn't be a thing when a character has a very defined background. Like no, it does not make sense to make Snow WHITE a poc when she's a 15th century German princess with \"skin as white as snow\". However, when I bring up how upset people would be if they culture swapped Tiana into being a white woman, people lose their minds on me, calling me racist and so on. I understand wanting more poc representation but that's why you make NEW characters with those backgrounds. And for those who claim \"white people dont have a culture\" as a way to excuse the culture swapping, white people DO have culture. \n\nI don't think this makes me racist as I'm not discriminating or hating on races, I'm simply just confused on all the double standards and why people keep trying to put black people on this almost untouchable podium of \"they do no wrong ever\" when the whole point is we're all trying to fight to be EQUAL.

But yet we fucking do it.\n\nShe canceled one of her shows just to reschedule to play a bigger venue now that she's more popular...that's so shitty to the fans who bought tickets MONTHS in advance.\n\nShe also canceled a show to play the VMAs without rescheduling. Also pretty shitty.\n\nNow, she canceled her set at All Things Go because of political comments SHE MADE AND POSTED ON TIKTOK. She obviously doesn't have a social media team because if she did they NEVER would've let her post that. I can't get into politics on this sub but I'll briefly say the things she said on her video were sad.\n\nNow more about the All Things Go cancelation: people spent money on plane tickets, hotels, and tickets to the festival. Obviously, they can still go and enjoy other performers like Renee Rapp, Laufey, and Hozier, but I'd be pretty pissed if the headliner pulled out not even 24 hours before she was supposed to perform.\n\nHer bullshit explanation she posted on her Instagram story:\n\n\"I apologize to the people who have been waiting to see me in NYC & DC this weekend at All Things Go, but I am unable to perform. Things have gotten overwhelming over the past few weeks and I am really feeling it. I feel pressures to prioritize a lot of things right now and I need a few days to prioritize my health. I want to be present when I perform and give the best shows possible. Thank you for understanding. Be back soon xoxo.\"\n\nShe obviously has no regard to the fans who spent thousands of dollars to see her. Obviously sometimes, shit happens (travel delays, illness, family emergencies) but just by saying \"I am unable to perform\" and \"I'm overwhelmed right now\" is no excuse.\n\nTaylor Swift did it with a broken heart, she performed a 3 HOUR CONCERT right after Joe Alwyn and her broke up.\n\nKaty Perry performed a concert 10 MINUTES after her (ex) husband asked her for a divorce.\n\nAriana Grande showed up for the fans after tragedy.\n\nTHERE IS NO EXCUSE WHY SHE COULDN'T PERFORM.\n\nChappell Roan just needs to accept she doesn't want this level of fame, or that she can't perform."

        "original_selftext": "So, before I start: I might possess a heavy bias because someone I know was gang-raped long back, she killed herself, *perpetrators weren\u2019t punished hard because minorsssss* and it became an insanely obsessively bad trigger for me. The definition of rape I will be arguing against here is penetration with criminal intent to rape with extratraumatic (ex. physical harm) intentions, while displaying intention doing so. It does not include rape merely on a \u201cno-consent\u201d basis, that does not deserve the punishment I am going here for. I am going here for a specific \u201climit\u201d past which you simply lose the right to live in a civilised society. From there, it\u2019s either executions or banishment, and banishment to international waters specifically. You lose your passport and identity. You are now stateless. Have fun.\n\nFirst things first, rape is one of the only crimes that are purely crimes of criminal intention. There are *no* situations where rape can possibly be justified. Murder? Can be justified in self-defense, wartime situations, wartime mass retaliatory situations. Japan was allowed to retain a self-defense force by common consensus. How about physical assault? Self-defense, certain situations requiring restraint to prevent crimes, sometimes the definition is too loose. Rape? Try justifying it. Self-defense, nope. Restraint, nope. Wartime? Civilian rape is a war crime (Geneva Convention IV: 27, 1949). Retaliation? Dude, nope. You cannot \u201caccidentally\u201d rape someone. You cannot go \u201coops I raped someone\u201d. Rape can never not be either premeditated or without criminal intention. Again, you can\u2019t go \u201cI saw her lying there, I felt like raping her, so I did\u201d. Unless you already have an intention of such nature, you wouldn\u2019t do it. A real person (again, I don\u2019t consider such criminals persons) would either cover her, make her comfortable, or do nothing. \n\nSecond, this also applies if you are 4 years old as long as you were involved. There is no age limit for the crime. You did it at 15, you\u2019ll do it at 50. Rehabilitation is not an option for the type of rape I am referring to. You cannot rehabilitate from that. It\u2019s the shopping cart dilemma. Rape is a crime that demonstrates your inner moral fibre and it does that permanently. I say the shopping cart dilemma because like in the case of mall shopping carts: you are not obliged to return them. Returning them is not justified in any case, mall employees will collect them later. It displays your moral opinion on whether you return it or not. Same with rape, given the fact that you could \u201cget away\u201d with rape, would you rape someone you really, really want? Murder could be justified saying \u201che killed my dad, I will kill him\u201d, sure. But rape? If your answer is yes, it came from within and instantly clarified all sorts of moral cloudiness I might have while sketching your character. \n\nThird, rape is often a crime done to demonstrate power. Like with my friend, it was like, fuck, it was her elder cousin\u2019s boyfriend and his classmates. Why? Displaying power. Unlike murder, which is often done for many reasons which may, in whatever small relevance, do \u201cneed\u201d murder, rape crimes cannot be \u201cneeded\u201d. You can say, \u201cshe knew something he shouldn\u2019t have, we had to eliminate her\u201d. You cannot do the same for rape.\n\nFourth, rape is a crime that will create lifelong consequences for the victim. Remind me, why don\u2019t we use old Roman or English style torturous executions now? (If the Founding Fathers of the USA were to lose the Revolutionary War, they would be hanged, drawn and quartered, not injected with cyanide). Because apparently it gives the victim pain he does not deserve, even if he is going to be dead anyways. Rape, will give you such insane amounts of trauma and mental pain that will make you go insane. Recently a method of mental execution was proposed where the death row prisoner could be artificially simulated to go through 1,000 years in less than 10 minutes. It was rejected because of \u201cextreme mental effects\u201d. I personally support it completely. You will suffer due to rape in ways unimaginable, literally. It becomes unbearable.\n\nI would list more reasons but I\u2019m unable to right now.\n\nFinally, I would like to complete my opinion that rape, in the manner I mentioned, should just revoke your right to life in a civilised society, and you should ideally be torturously executed. Bring back Roman and English style executions. I have zero sympathy for such a rapist, they cease to be a civilised human."

And a huge majority of muslims today started to fight for people in Palestine who were displaced after living there for hundreds of years, what about the pagans and jews of Pre-islamic Medina who were forcefully and wrongfully exiled from medina? i see those same muslims praising Muhammed yet complain when a muslim majority muslim population of their own gets displaced.\n\nAnd id like to clarify that i do not support what Israel did to the palestinians, i just think when most of the muslim community speaks out against it, its very hypocritical given what they did to medina and many other places, not just Medina"

If you grocery shop in any way you\u2019d know that produce is cheap as hell. They\u2019re practically throwing it at you before it goes bad. A hash brown at McDonald\u2019s is on average $3 in America, with some areas having them cost as much as $5. That\u2019s the price of a whole ass breakfast sandwich. At my nearest grocery store you can buy a 5lbs sack of potatoes for as little as $1.50 when they\u2019re on sale. Same goes for other fruits and vegetables. Just looking at my grocery store deals; you can get a pound of tomatoes for $2, honeycrisp apples for $1.50/lbs, cucumbers, bell peppers, cabbage, avocados, mangoes, and beefsteak tomatoes are all under $1. 12oz of carrots for $1.29, pre-cut broccoli for $2/12oz, the list goes on and that\u2019s just my first glance. \u201cBut my chick fil a salad was more expensive than the chicken sandwich \u201d then stop getting salad at fast food places. They\u2019re robbing you.\n\nMeat is obviously a different story but you can still capitalize on deals if you pay a little attention. I got a slab of pork for 99\u00a2/pound not long ago. I got multiple packages of chicken for under $2/pound around the same time and my freezer is still full.\n\nYes I know location can cause this to be harder but my area is one of the most popular  parts of the country to be in right now and I live in the city too, not 3 hours away where it drops even lower. I\u2019m also far from rich and can make it work.\n\nI\u2019ll at least accept time as an obstacle because people seem to have more bullshit to deal with than I do but you can still get around that if you plan well. If you\u2019re going to be busy for the next few days and have no time to cook then take one day after work or on a weekend to cook a larger batch and meal prep. There\u2019s so many fast recipes out there that take one pot, cooking is arguably the easiest it\u2019s ever been. Buying seasonings and whatnot can be a lot upfront depending but they last you a long time, especially if you buy in bulk which saves you even more in the long run. \n\nTl;dr eating healthy and eating well is not as hard as people make it out to be. It\u2019s cheaper to eat healthy and healthy food tastes good too. Time varies greatly but there\u2019s other avenues you can take to make it easier. It\u2019s about the desire to eat well, not your ability. \n\nEdit: A great comment reminded me that eating disorders exist. That's a whole different can of worms I am not qualified to comment on but I don't envy those that struggle with them."

        "original_title": "The USA DOES have culture. ",
        "original_selftext": "I am absolutely exhausted with always hearing \u201cthe US has no culture\u201d or \u201cAmerica has no culture\u201d. Culture, by one of many definitions, is usually summed up as \u201cthe way of life\u201d for a particular region or society. The main key components which make up this \u201cway of life\u201d are beliefs and values, language, customs and traditions, art and literature, social norms, and religion. Every single country has these components. \n\nBeliefs and values: America is probably one of the loudest when it comes to voicing their opinions and beliefs. No matter what side of the spectrum an American is on, you cannot tell me that they do not have beliefs and values that they stand behind. We believe in the American dream, in freedom of both religion and speech, individualism, etc. sure it varies from person to person, but EVERYONE has beliefs. Americans included. \n\nLanguage: There are no less than 430 languages spoken in the US, each having their own unique and distinctive characteristics, inflections, turns of phrase, etc. This means that the American you\u2019re picturing in your head, the one that speaks English, DOES have a cultural language. Just like everyone else. English is just like any other language and it is most definitely a part of someone\u2019s culture. \n\nCustoms and traditions: There are absolutely holidays that originated in the US. Memorial Day, Labor Day, the 4th of July, Juneteenth, MLK Day, Veterans Day, etc. Every single family has traditions and customs that they observe for some of these holidays. That is their culture. For example; my family always hosts an ornament swap near Christmas time. We all make homemade ornaments for each other, pass them out at a party, play games, etc. That IS a tradition. That IS part of my culture. Just because you do not value the holiday or see any importance in it does not mean it is not a cultural experience for those who celebrate them. \n\nArt and Literature: There are 35,000 museums in America that all host an amazing dedication to sharing all ranges of art. That is the largest amount of museums in the world. People in the US do have an appreciation for arts and I know it is a favorite date idea for my husband and I to visit and be in awe of some amazing local artists. \n\nSocial Norms: This is obviously a large variable and can have some wide discrepancies depending on the area, but,  just like any other country, the US does have a general sense of what is socially acceptable. It is rude to ask someone how much money they make, we tip our servers, we are generally informal in most speaking situations, we value being on time, etc. Again: the US has a social culture. You may not like it or agree with it, but it is there. It is part of how we function on a daily basis. \n\nWhether or not find inherent value in these particular components of American culture doesn\u2019t really matter. They are still, by definition, what makes up the American \u201cway of life\u201d. They are still the US\u2019s CULTURE. \n\nTL/DR: English IS a part of US culture. Holiday celebrations ARE a part of US culture. Our beliefs and values ARE a part of the US culture. Social norms and dos/don\u2019t ARE a part of US culture. Just because you don\u2019t like/agree with/find our customs or traditions important doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t a part of the US\u2019s culture. \n"

(its an opinion)\n\nFirst, get therapy to help yourself, but afterward, you should only date others like you.\n\nCheaters, you betrayed someone's trust, you reap the consequence of that action. It is NOT a mistake.\n\nAbuser, you hurt someone you were supposed to love, you reap the consequences of that action. It is NOT a mistake.\n\nTherefore, you should only date other cheaters, or other abusive people like you. And hopefully you find your love amongst the other cheaters and abusive people like you. (Firstly, like I say therapy, but it doesn't erase your past and you should live wearing that into your future relationship with other cheaters or abusive people)\n\nLeave the rest of the human society who did not cheat or abuse others find some sense of normal relationships with others.\n\nI see the kindest of people get cheated on after trying their best and get blamed it is their fault. \n\nIt's already hard enough for people to find good people, the cheaters and abusive people should do single people a favor and only date other cheaters and abusive people like themselves. **(*****NOT criss-cross cheater to abuser, ONLY cheater to cheater and abuser to abuser)***\n\nSorry, not sorry."

        "original_selftext": "Don't get me wrong, \n\nI am not a middle aged man talking about classic rock and blues saying \"all modern stuff is crap, they don't do it like led zeppelin\", I am a senior in highschool and I've just had my fair share of open mindedly listening to everything and just wanted to share my thoughts.\n\nI am a huge fan of blues, rock, metal, funk, jap-jazz infusion, pop, etc....  \nI LOVE music, and I am genuinely open to listening to anything, it doesnt mean i'll like it, but I'll try it.\n\nAs I've listened through the decades, I've realized how much the effort in genuine songwriting has changed, and I'm tired of pretending like all these new hit stars are \"so so so so GOOD\" just because they're the new trend. I am NOT saying all the new stuff is crap, i like a lot of new artists but there is also a mass amount of music now that is so dry, boring, and not whatsoever unique. I understand that everyone likes different music and my opinion is NOT set in stone so if you disagree I will not be offended.\n\nI compare stars like Sabrina Carpenter and every other female popstar to the women of back then, like Cyndi Lauper, Mary J. Blige, Lita Ford, etc.... Albeit they are not the same genre whatsoever and did not have the same worldwide success that people like Sabrina Carpenter have now, but they weren't in the right time and generation to experience that success, however they were extremely influential in their genres and hit the charts many times. When I listen to Sabrina Carpenter, I cannot express how BORING her music is, it's not very unique whatsoever or interesting, i'm not saying she's a bad artist, she's got a wonderful voice, but she's yet another female pop artist, writing the same corny scorned love lyrics, who just happens to have a very good voice. This goes for men as well and this is NOT DIRECTED AT WOMEN, it is just an example. \n\nRap I feel has also taken a turn for a more uninteresting place, it is filled with either women who only have traction because they rap about the same sexual lyrics while wearing lingerie and twerking the whole time, or dudes who dress incredibly stupid, rap about doing drugs, counting money, \"fucking bitches\", braggin about their success, talking about people doubting them, and once in a while genuinely talking about their struggles. Alot of these rappers haven't really experienced some genuine hardship however so when they speak about it in their songs I can only think about how fake they are.  Every 808 beat sounds the same, most of them have the most basic flow, same annoying monotone voice that stays within octave and when they try to sing they shove the worst autotuned vocal line down your eardrums. There are exceptions, and these are because they produce genuinely interesting songs, or are creative, or generally are just really cool artists, Kendrick Lamar has some songs I think are musically interesting, Tyler The Creator is unlike many others I've heard in this generation, Ye, despite his drama, has created songs that have actually made me feel very personal about certain things. \n\nI am in NO WAY trying to put down people's favorite art, nor praying on these artists downfall, but if you compare the average hit of back in the 80s to now, yes I will say their synth filled wonders do sound similar, but most of those songs genuinely sounded unique. \"take on me\" by A-ha, \"message in a bottle\" by the police, \"Nothing else matters\" by metallica, \"little red corvette\" by prince,  \"Off the wall\" by michael jackson,  \"Jump\" by Van Halen,  \"I'm Broken\" by Pantera, etc... They all debuted up in the charts and they were all so musically different an interesting, so unique and interesting to listen to. The musicianship was on a different level compared to now, with bands and artists finding ways to push the boundaries of what they could do with their instruments and equipment. The lyrics, although not all the time serious, had more effort in a majority of songs, or at least didnt sound so basic and boring.\n\nAgain there are exceptions and I'm not saying today's music absolutely sucks, I may not like a lot of it but I will not blatantly say it all sucks, and I mainly pointed out genres of today that are more popular. Before anyone attacks me for my white girl pop opinions, I love a few artists of the pop genre and personally i've taken to chappel roan, albeit she has similar lyrics but she has a different atmosphere about her, from the queer representation, to drag, to the unique choices of synth and structure in her music, it is very reminiscent of 80's synth. \n\n"

Because that is a boundary you are presumably uncomfortable with. \n\nIt is not your place to try and change someone's boundaries. It is not right to cross someone's boundaries no matter how unreasonable. You don't have to follow that boundary, but you shouldn't stay with someone with boundaries you find unreasonable.\n\nI didn't think this was that controversial. I posted a damn meme about this. So many people seemed to miss the second half of the point. If someone is considering something cheating that is unreasonable, you should leave.\n\nLastly, I'm polyamorus. This is not a reaction to my boundaries being pressed or crossed. I don't think any of the examples I gave here are cheating. In fact I don't think most of what society considers cheating to be cheating for me personally. Because it's subjective. The meme and this post is a reaction to seeing people having their boundaries crossed by people who don't respect them.\n\nMaybe a boundary is unreasonable, but it is not your place to push or cross the boundary. It is your place to find someone else. "

        "original_selftext": "Okay, hear me out.  So I know that anytime somebody gets into the medical field (aka nurses/doctors/paramedics/etc.) it is typically to help makes positive difference to people and their quality of life during the time they are dealing with a health issue, and they are often held to a higher standard in society in which they are pressured into maintaining a certain level of professionalism, even within their personal lives.\n\nPeople who work in medicine work extremely hard to achieve that goal (especially highly specialized doctors), but all medically trained employed medical staff do, and they work crazy hours that most of us couldn\u2019t imagine like Doctor residencies in which you work on call in the hospital for like a 48h shift or 36 hours or something like that.  And so many nurses have experienced horrible verbal, physical and personal attacks by awful rude patients and/or their patients\u2019 family.\n\nUsually the reason they are entering such a profession is because of a desire to help people, and I think that\u2019s where this idea that if there\u2019s ever a medical issue in a public/off-duty situation, they are just expected to go assist. \n\nThat being said, caregiver burnout is so incredibly common to the point where said caregiver (of any kind but in this situation I\u2019m specifically referencing medical personnel who care for others all day, with such long hours and often poor work environments these days due to under-staffing and being stuck with an excessive amount of patients that would normally need like 3 people to cover in the past).  Not to mention due to the issue I mentioned, they have no time to take even a bathroom break or eat a granola bar let alone a full break.  As mentioned before medical staff often receive so much verbal abuse among other types when patients/families are cranky and rude when they don\u2019t get everything their way, and I personally (I\u2019m 27F, spent literally more than half my life in hospitals due to a degenerative medical condition caused by a combination of a variety of genetic mutations and I\u2019m currently on hospice with about 3-6 weeks to live, so I feel like I\u2019m fully qualified to talk about these topics lol) have watched patients or their families who *literally* will interrupt a code blue (for people unaware of medical terms, a code blue means that a person is not breathing or their heart is stopped) where there are so many staff in a room trying to save this person\u2019s life) and the patient/family will see what\u2019s going on as people are rotating on CPR as well as doing so many other things like setting up equipment or IVs, and \u201cbagging\u201d (using a device to blow air into the patients\u2019 lungs manually which requires squeezing a balloon-like chamber at a steady pace) and they *still* have the AUDACITY to stand in the doorway whining and complaining that they or their family member wants a warm blanket/water/some other non-emergent thing and they pressed the call bell and are going on about how it\u2019s taking too long.  As if a warm blanket or ice water is more important than someone\u2019s life and the lives of everyone who loves that person.  And finally, on top of all things mentioned, they also have to cope with the feelings when a patient passes away, especially a child or baby or the one where the professional has formed a good relationship with and cares so much about that patient and potentially their family.  They have to watch in person as people witness love ones die and the screams of pure heartbreak and pain, or calling the patient\u2019s family to tell them they\u2019ve passed and hearing it over the phone.  Even worse, they have to go right back to their work with their other patients and pretend they\u2019re okay.  This is sometimes a multiple time a day occurrence, and there\u2019s no wonder why they might be needing a break to recharge and soothe their souls so that they can return to work with fresh energy. \n\nThey could be on that flight for a destination vacation (alone or with their families), or to visit loved ones in other countries, and sometimes they are travelling for work like perhaps to speak at a conference etc.  Either way, this flight should be the beginning of the unwinding, de-stressing, relaxing and healing trip they\u2019ve planned.  And then\u2026BAM.  Over the intercom \u201ccould any medical staff please come to the front of the plane/wherever to assist with a medical issue/concern/duration?\u201d and they feel obligated or maybe people know they are medically trained and force them to go assist them. When that\u2019s the EXACT thing you\u2019re trying to take a break from, it ruins the flight for them.\n\nSo I think them and the people they were travelling with (if any), should receive ticket refunds from the airline as well as first-class tickets anywhere the airline goes at no cost to be used at any time.  They deserve to enjoy their flight that\u2019s commencing the beginning of their time away from anything medical and it was now tainted and they can\u2019t enjoy the relaxation that a lot of people experience while flying.  It also means that the people they were travelling with were also affected, and by issuing the first class ticket situation I\u2019m proposing, it\u2019s likely that they would be redoing that recharging trip and bringing their family/same travel partners (if they brought anybody), and by only giving that medical person that free first class destination of your choice ticket, they would then have to pay out of pocket for really expensive tickets, especially if they choose somewhere far away and paying for first class for the others out of pocket to feel included and happy and celebrating the start of an exciting vacation all together (not them alone in a great amazing seat with extra services while their loved ones are somewhere else on the plane that still cost huge sums of money to afford).\n\nNote: if anyone wants to say that they can afford to pay for their loved ones to come with and they can pay their own way etc. etc\u2026., while it\u2019s true a lot of jobs in the medical field pay well, but some people are still paying off like 6-digit amounts of money in student loans.  It\u2019s really not always as simple as you might think.\n\nSorry for the novel, hot-take: done lol *I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts\ud83d\ude42*\n\nAlso I\u2019m sorry in advance for some of the weird typos/extra random words that don\u2019t make sense in that context because Ugh\u2026it\u2019s literally not allowing me to click up top (using iPhone) to fix where I\u2019ve forgotten to add an end bracket etc. Every time I get to the top parts of the post that I can\u2019t see due to how much I wrote, as soon as press for my cursor it literally just brings me all the way down to the bottom again . I\u2019ve even tried double-tapping to try to select a word, still brought strain back to the end AGAIN so I literally can\u2019t even put this apology at the top now either \ud83d\ude21. So sorry, please don\u2019t come for me grammar police I promise I\u2019m more upset about it than you are.\n\n[Edit was for grammar because it kind of let it fix some things this way] "

Like, *truly* doing it right. Then I heard a preacher one day say that the mistake people make us following the religion when all we have to do is follow Jesus. \n\nAs time went by, i drifted from my faith, I became much more science minded, and I have neutral feelings about religion. But the *one* thing is that I do agree that Jesus is a perfect example. Stand up for those who need it. Don\u2019t shun people who make mistakes. Don\u2019t mix sales/money and spirituality. Help other people, not because you like them, but because they are a human who needs help. Love people. Listen to others. Give a chance to the people who everybody else gave up on. \n\nThe problem is that no one will ever actually follow this. I don\u2019t know if the man was even real, but the message I absolutely can get behind. And the \u201cultimate\u201d message of sacrificing yourself for others. We now live in a world where no one wants to do anything unless they get something out of it. But then we simultaneously complain that nothing is the same or people are disconnected. We don\u2019t even love or care for other humans. It\u2019s like a trend to be edgy and hate humanity or have a group of people you hate. \n\nTLDR: Jesus is a good example when separated from the religion, but everyone hates each other too much to actually show love and kindness.

These people are paradoxically more likely to be good people than those who think of themselves as good people, since they are willing to see themselves objectively, listen to criticism, and examine their behavior from an unbiased, honest view and make course corrections. \n\nhttps://thedecisionlab.com/biases/dunning-kruger-effect"

Not only that but hiring teens actors could severely limit job opportunities for actors in their 20s\n\nso I propose a better solution; let\u2019s make more shows about characters in their 20s that not only can actors in their 20s play characters who look like them and face similar struggles but it will also make a lot of the tropes more appropriate, sure a 40 year old sleeping with a 20 year old is still problematic but it\u2019s nowhere near as bad as a high school teacher sleeping with their student\n\nnow I made this post afew years ago and someone pointed out to me that most college kids barely have any free time to watch tv which is true however studies show that a third of gen z is skipping college and entering the workplace younger so that\u2018s also something you need to consider\n\ngood day"

The claims that obesity doesn't cause/exacerbate health problems. The claims that some people can eat at a calorie deficit and magically defy physics and not lose weight.\n\nOn the other hand, I do see a lack of compassion for the circumstances that can lead to weight gain and unwarranted cruelty towards fat people.

        "original_selftext": "Idk I was just reading about the recent Chapell Roan drama and it really got me thinking. Have we always expected celebrities to voice their opinions on these issues? \n\nI understand the need for celebrities to be vocal about certain things, over which they have a certain extent of power\u2013like them donating and encouraging others to donate for a certain cause, like homeless shelters, or LGBT+ organizations, or for refugee relief, or anything that can make some change, and using their platform to help those in need. \n\nBut why are some people expecting them to endorse a certain presidential candidate or express dislike for another, and then getting mad at them if they don't? Like, that's an artist, and they're entitled to their own opinions (which can be just as educated/uneducated as the average person's\u2013them being a celebrity doesn't make them automatically an expert). Also, if a celebrity wants to show their support of a certain candidate in public, good for them I guess, but is it really necessary for every celebrity to announce which candidate they prefer/will be voting for and why?\n\nThis may sound mean spirited, but what does Chapell Roan know about politics? She's entitled to her opinion and she can vote as an american citizen, but why is it her duty to tell her fans \"go vote for candidate X or Y\"? She just makes fun music, why should she (or any celebrity) need to voice opinions on such a serious matter in public?\n\nAnd I know that for some celebrities who have been very vocal about their political views, it's almost always just for show, with a manager and a publicist telling them what to say in every step, so why bother at all? I don't blame them, I get it's all a curated image to make them as likeable as possible, but why are we bothering to listen to these people who are varying degrees of talented in some artistic field?"

It\u2019s how people communicated without leaving the house, or how kids were able to continue schooling. \n\nCompanies took advantage of the pandemic to make the online space more profitable and corporate. Compare this to even a few years ago when most outcasts turned to the internet rather than real life. Now, *everyone* does because they got so used to that reality from the pandemic. Companies saw that and reformed their ads to be more effective and snappy.\n\nInternet culture feels more *manufactured* rather than genuine.

        "original_title": "Hard Work Is An Increasingly Antiquated Value",
        "original_selftext": "In the US, people put such a huge cultural emphasis on the value of hard work, and it's really not very intelligent.  They want people to be working all the time.  Work 2 jobs, work a job or two jobs while you're also going to college...  Work work work.  The thing is, hard work is increasingly becoming worth less and less. Some of the hardest working people in the world are paid the least (like vegetable pickers on farms, or people who work in meat processing plants, for example), and social connections, intelligence, or coming from a wealthy family are more important and useful predictors of success in the economy.\n\nNot to mention that the wealthy make a lot more money than the typical person does in their [bs job](https://www.vox.com/2018/5/8/17308744/bullshit-jobs-book-david-graeber-occupy-wall-street-karl-marx#:~:text=Bullshit%20jobs%20are%20everywhere,%20David%20Graeber) just by raking in money from their stock portfolios and other investments.\n\nWhich brings me to another point.  A lot of jobs are just not that useful to society and are in the process of being taken over by machines. Check out the fast food places that are now operated by robots for one example of this. In the absence of an abundant supply of fast food laborers, businesses would just work to automate those jobs faster.\n\nI think hard work is valued so much by society for three main reasons:\n\n1. It serves the interests of those who have money & property by being able to blame the average person for their own financial problems by just claiming they have problems because they just didn't work hard enough, which distracts judgmental normies from the wealthy elites swimming in money as everyone else suffers.\n2. Normies who work in bs jobs tell themselves they're working hard because it makes them feel like a valuable and good person, particularly when they denigrate others in society who, in their view, aren't working as hard as they are. Lets be honest... everyone loves feeling like they're better than others.\n3. People like to imagine that people who work harder are rewarded for that because it creates the illusion that there is an element of fairness to the massive wealth disparities of society.\n\nAnd a lot of people will argue the problem is that some of these people who work hard aren't doing work that is smart enough, as if studying more and intelligence are what is needed.  However, this isn't exactly true either.  There is a lot of truth to the phrase:  *\"it's not what you know, it's who you know.\"* Cronyism gets you better jobs, promotions, and money arguably more effectively than either hard work or even intelligence.\n\nEven if it was true though that smart work was the solution, it wouldn't really make the system more ethical or moral because no person is morally responsible for being born with an IQ of 120 instead of 80. And that higher IQ opens up all sorts of doors for a person.  Like, can you be a highly paid doctor with your career, or do you end up working an unpleasant and poorly paid job?\n\nTo which some people say \"life isn't fair... get used to it\"... but then neglect to consider the fact that this demand undermines the values system they also espouse when they say people who work hard deserve more rewards.\n\nPlacing such value on hard work in the context of a republic like the US is even more questionable considering those who spend all their time working probably aren't paying much attention to what is going on in the world of politics. (If you work two jobs, or attend a college while working a job, honestly... who has time?) It's obviously a recipe for disasters and bad government policies that waste financial resources (the fruits of people's \"hard work\"...lol) and screw the society.\n\nIt's all a big lie.  The \"life isn't fair... get used to it\" response is the most honest, but if you're going to say that you shouldn't also emphasize the value of hard work and deserved rewards because for the many reasons stated that view is bs. It' all seems very arbitrary."

I'm saying this as a woman myself, her behavior and mindset towards men is disgusting. Her fake EXTREME confidence that she puts on like a mask is what gives all her fans and followers the comfort to treat men like paypigs and label it as \"what they deserve\" and what is \"not the bare minimum\". And the thing is, if gender roles were switched in this situation I'm %100 sure it would be considered as disrespect. If Liz was a man with this exact mindset and goldigging money from women and calling it \"not stooping to the lowest\", expecting to be treated like a king, people would hate her. Especially women. So when women have this mindset it's ok, it's normal, it's what they deserve but if men did the same suddenly it's a problem? This is the most stupid thing I've ever heard. Liz's expectations are insanely high. I honestly feel bad for that man she is getting engaged too. This mindset of hers may be for \"healing her inner child\" but that doesn't excuse her from her extreme standards that she has normalized so much. People who actually listen to her for reasons like this, to attract men who will spoil them are all brainwashed. And I know for sure the second a man did the same thing as Thewizardliz they would go crazy. It\u2019s funny honestly. Thewizardliz and her fans need to understand that just because they were born into this world as a different gendered being doesn't mean they are gonna be worshipped and spoiled by men. We are all specks of dust in this whole universe and gender doesn't matter and it doesn't give you the right to be a narcissistic asshole that basically thinks she deserves men's whole lives revolving around her and masks it with \"healing inner child\" \"having confidence\" \"being healthy\" whatsoever. The sexism, ego and toxicity being completely ignored by Liz's fans is crazy, this is just not Liz and her fans I generally mean the women who revolve around the term \"Dark feminism\""

All this while Baby Blue was playing in the background.\n\nI've seen many opinions from people saying they hate Walt and the actions he did, but I feel he gets a whole lot of more hate than he deserves. I personally don't like Jesse, and feel that he genuinely deserves more hate than Walt does. Walt tried so many times to help him, but all the time Jesse was just an insufferable prick who kept swearing at Walt and disrespecting him and showing attitude.\n\nAnyway, just wanted to see if someone else feels that Walter doesn't deserve the amount of hate he gets."

        "original_title": "Conservative, liberal, progressive: What do these words even mean?",
        "original_selftext": "Liberal. Conservative. Progressive. These words all have something in common. Can you guess? They have no meaning without context. For example: during some periods of history the \"conservative\" opinion was for strong central government and higher taxes.\n\nI've heard many current self proclaimed conservatives accuse anyone that doesn't agree with them of being liberal. It's ridiculous. If I heard it from liberals, I would think it's equally ridiculous. The world's not that simple. Most people don't think of themselves in those terms. I certainly don't, mostly because I honestly don't know any more what's truly liberal or conservative. I also know it doesn't matter. The issues matter. And here's how I feel about the big issues facing society today. \n\nI think environmental protection is important. And I'm not just talking about the still politically (though not scientifically) refuted anthropogenic climate change. Just generally not allowing anyone or any company to throw their waste, solid, liquid or gas, anywhere they want. Products that last a few days or weeks shouldn't be packaged in something that hangs around in the world chemically unchanged for thousands of years. Packaging manufacturers need to be incentivized to develop products that are degradable or easily recyclable. Until then we can expect the trash gyres in the Pacific to grow and others to form. Continue this growth path and our great grandchildren can enjoy oceans more covered in trash than not.\n\nI believe we need to be rational about gun control. It's a very broad interpretation of the second amendment (I've read it many times, it's not long) that allows for unrestricted gun ownership for all citizens. Read it and explain to me why it references \"state militia\" if it really applies to citizens as individuals? Explain to me how it forbids any sensible restrictions such as requiring a licensing test much like a driver's license? Why would any sensible person be against that? I don't want an unlicensed gun owner next to me for the same reason I don't want an unlicensed driver in the next lane.\n\nI believe that the divide between the extremely wealthy and the middle class has increased too much. I'm not sure how to solve this, but consider my example. In the 2000s I worked for a company that reviewed earnings and profits quarterly with all employees. Our goal, when I started, was 20% revenue growth and 20% net income growth each quarter. We hit it so often that when I left it had increased to 30 / 30. My salary? It increased 15% over 7 years. Bonuses? Under 5% of salary, usually not the 10% originally promised. The company, single owner, was growing over 30% year over year. Also, the company billed time and a half for any work we did after hours. Not only did we not see any of that, but we were strongly discouraged from taking a day off the week following weekend work. If we did, it often came out of our PTO. Just to be clear, after a 60 hour week with 8 hours plus Monday through Friday, and another 8 or more on Saturday, we were required to work at least a full 40 the following week. And we didn't get paid for the extra hours. Meanwhile the owner was pocketing 30% more each quarter. I never got a quarterly raise or bonus. I'm not saying owners don't deserve to benefit, but is it right that they take so much and give so little? When the highest paid person in a company makes hundreds of thousands of times more money than the lowest paid employee how can you logically argue that they provide that much more value to the company? The rules and regulations governing the market make it seem like they do, but is the accounting truly accurate? What variables are missing?\n\nI believe in the sanctity of the human body. Nobody should have the right to tell another person what they can or cannot do with their own body. We don't force people to donate organs even after they're dead. So why is it ok to force a woman to expel a dead fetus \"naturally\" at the risk of future pregnancies and their life itself? (It's called a D&C and although it's usually legal, procedures have been challenged and women have died). The government shouldn't place itself in the way of a mother, her doctor and her potential child. A potential human is not a human, and should have no legal rights, and certainly not to the body in which it resides. Religious? God created women so that for almost 9 months, no other individual can replace her. No technology exists that can put that fetus in another person or allow it to live outside the mother. God trusted mothers, humans should too. Late term abortions? How many women really go through a long, laborious pregnancy only to abort at the last minute just, \"because\"? And if a pregnancy is really viable at that late stage, no doctor \"aborts\". The woman gives birth. The baby is NOT murdered, and yes, it would be murder because the baby can live outside the mother. There's already laws against that so no need to panic the ignorant that it actually happens.\n\nI believe separation of church and state. The idea is not just in the Bill of Rights, it's also in the general body of the Constitution.\n\nI believe in a person's right to be free from government prosecution for what they say, and that the government should not be allowed to stop them from saying it. I also believe that corporations do not share those rights. A company is not \"a person\" and allowing a company to donate money to political campaigns in the guise of \"free speech\" is preposterous. In the same way that a newspaper, radio station, tv station, or social media platform (aka companies, corporations, or organizations) can't be required to allow all people to use its service to speak, they shouldn't be afforded the same rights as individuals when \"speaking\". If the CEO or Chairman of a company wants to donate personal money to a campaign, let them. But a corporate leader shouldn't be allowed to use corporate money and corporate employees speaking on behalf of the company, maybe even against their individual opinion, to influence the political process.\n\nI believe that, while an individual member of the media can speak freely without government prosecution, if they lie as the representative of a media company, the company should be held liable. In other words, when a Fox News host claims that the election was stolen without supplying evidence, they cannot be prosecuted or held liable except under the already very strict rules. Fox News, however, should enjoy no such protection. They should be held liable when their statements can be proved false. Whether it was just the \"opinion\" of their representative or not, whether it was done with malice or not, it's a statement that can be proved factually true or false, and the media organization should be held accountable for broadcasting the lie. Slippery slope or not, we're slipping in the wrong direction when mass media outlets are allowed to willfully mislead the public. And to all those screaming \"the mass media is already liberally biased\", there's a big difference between using adjectives to elicit a specific emotional response, and lying about the facts. For example, saying \"illegal immigrants are eating pets\" is a statement that can be factually proven. When no proof surfaces, it's a lie. When people in the community and community leaders claim it's not true, then it's a lie. It is the media outlet's responsibility to clearly state it's a lie, when an attempt is made to use their medium to spread it. Don't think the lie, \"illegal immigrants eat pets\" requires censure? Even up to the early 20th century, Jews in Europe were falsely and broadly accused of using the blood of Christian babies for Passover wine. See the similarity?\n\nI believe in the market, but also realize that \"free market\" is an impossible myth. Markets require rules to function, otherwise all disagreements would devolve into violence. Objections  citing \"free market\" should be dismissed out of hand. Instead, explain how the legislation will shape the market in a bad direction.\n\nAll human organizations are dysfunctional to some degree. Corporations are not inherently more functional just because they are singularly focused on money and profits. Government organizations are not inherently less functional just because they have different and often difficult to define goals. Government organizations should not be obsessed with the bottom line. They should stick to their budget, and spend money wisely, but their goal is to provide a service, not to save or make money. When a corporation is hired to provide the service, they will attempt to extract profit. If the organization they're replacing was well run, their only recourse is to cut services. And if it was poorly run, they'll cut some fat for the first few years, but where will they cut when the fat's gone? Really think for profit organizations stop seeking profit?\n\nI believe in a strong federal government and a strong U.S. military, and I'd argue that modern conservatives do too, because they keep increasing Presidential executive power. I also believe that finding Presidential Immunity in the constitution is a stretch of logical imagination that Socrates might be proud of. We all learned in grade school that our founders didn't want a king which is why we have a president. Kings are immune, Presidents are accountable.\n\nI believe Social Darwinism is a grave misapplication of the theory of evolution. Especially in light of research proving that large trees in a forest send excess sugars down and out through their roots to neighboring trees, helping younger and shorter vegetation of all types to flourish. Not to mention all the nutrient sharing that occurs between plants via the fungus that surrounds their roots. Evolution is more complicated than a selfish individual struggle for survival. Often, the survivors have survived because they've cooperated with others in their environment, instead of fighting.\n\nThese are just broad strokes and certainly incomplete. Feel free to categorize my beliefs as you see fit. I'm happy knowing where I stand. I'm also flexible enough to change my opinions based on new evidence. Are you?\n\n  \n#semi\\_wild\\_cat"

One example would be the body positivity movement. \n\nThe kind thing to do is sometimes the harsh or difficult thing. If you notice a friend heading down a bad path, such as they stop exercising and start eating unhealthy junk food all the time and start gaining weight, the kind thing to do is address this behavior (in a kind manner of course - no insulting) and state your concerns. Think about it: if you care for a person, you don\u2019t want to see them get hurt or kill themselves with bad habits.\n\nBut the leftist way to deal with such a situation is to tell the friend: you\u2019re beautiful just the way you are, you don\u2019t need to change a thing. While in the moment, this might make you feel good and your friend feel comforted, it sets your friend up for failure in the long run.\n\nThis is one of many examples. I believe leftism confuses people pleasing with kindness, and it has good intentions which will hurt people in the long run."

However, the product caused controversy due to a miscommunication in its advertising, where it seemed like they claimed it was outright \"healthy.\" This angered many people, and soon after, figures like DanTDM began criticizing Lunchly. What happened next was that KSI and Logan Paul responded by insulting DanTDM and everyone else who criticized Lunchly, doing so in a foolish manner instead of focusing on the message that it\u2019s just \"healthier than Lunchables.\" In contrast, MrBeast responded more appropriately on his Twitter, addressing the situation properly by explaining that Lunchly is only meant to be the healthier alternative to Lunchables.\n\nDespite this, many people still blame MrBeast just as much as KSI and Logan Paul. However, I believe that MrBeast was the only one who handled the situation correctly, and he doesn't deserves the hate for Lunchly.\n\nFor those who didn\u2019t read this or still don\u2019t understand: I am not saying that this WON\u2019T affect MrBeast\u2019s popularity, but what I am saying is that it SHOULDN\u2019T, because he was the only one who at least tried to handle things the right way, while KSI and Logan Paul acted like complete idiots."

Capitalism is greedy! so people think its bad, while equality is good so everyone understands its good, so you just need to repeat to people that their right.\n\nBut is equality really something that exists, even in nature? or is it more like idealism and fantasyland. If we build our society on the basis of equality what are we REALLY building it on.\n\nInstead of learning math, science, even other languages, why do we choose to learn useless stuff like gender studies or equality studies. What's more practical? speaking of practical, spending our money time and resources on equality, well we better hope its a real thing that exists if were spending everything on it.\n\nIf Equality doesn't exist when your born, how can it exist when you die? or even in the middle stage of life? This is a basic truth.\n\nGod judged people on their actions, God said the poor woman who gave literal cents gave more than a rich man because it was all she owned so she gave 100 percent then a rich person who gave tons of money according to god actually gave less.\n\nIs reaching equality even possible? well, humans would choose murder, violence, etc anyway even in perfect conditions, even in complete equality. How do we treat them equally, what about tall people and short people, blind people and deaf people, dumb people and smart people, physically strong people and weak people.\n\nI think real equality calls for a HIVE MIND, like an ant colony. Which is why force needs to be used to enforce equality, ruling with an iron fist, a dictatorship, censorship, propaganda, and lies.\n\nI think real equality calls for the absence of a choice in the matter.\n\nI feel like we need to be logical, intelligent over emotional, maybe even ruthlessly logical.\n\nNow its easy to villainize those that go against equality. But i believe that's just desperation. Some people equality is all they ever wanted, all they ever fight for, its their peace, they don't have religion and they need to worship something.\n\nI believe when you don't have Jesus, Equality is the best thing you end up clinging on to.\n\nBut remember logically, equality is just being very very idealistic. Its not reality. Its ineffective to strive for. And eventually your going to implode which means explode from the inside because there will come a point where equality needs to be both a bloody regime in order to be enforced and a point where it cant keep up with the demands of the people. I believe the people who want equality will also never be satisfied due to human nature.\n\nCapitalism is built on greed, But it works.\n\nbut the people see communism as an alternative. they dont even care if it failed and led to brutal bloody regimes and hundreds of millions of dead bodies. They are made to think to hate their current life and system to chase after this equality, brainwashed into thinking its a better alternative when really they are weak willed and chasing after something unattainable and incredibly innefficient.\n\n"

        "original_selftext": "This is something I\u2019ve had an opinion on for a long time, but have never had the chance to truly express it. First and foremost, I want to begin by saying that I do not at all think that one gender faces more problems than another. All people face problems no matter who you are. However, my issue lies in the fact that I feel as if women\u2019s problems are talked about and taken seriously. Women have so many resources that they can use for their issues that arise. Men don\u2019t. Men are sadly often discouraged from seeking mental help because of social stigmas. Certain resources are made to help women specifically, and I feel that that is neglecting roughly half of the population. Women have shelters they can go to in times of domestic abuse, but men do not. Sometimes, when police are called to a domestic violence dispute, the man will end up being arrested even when he was clearly the victim. That brings me to my next point. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve been watching a tv show or movie and seen a woman abusing a man being played for comedy. That sickens me. All abuse is wrong, but the fact that someone\u2019s mistreatment is being used to make people laugh. Especially when the opposite scenario would never be taken lightly. I\u2019ve also seen it where a woman will act sexually aggressive with a man and it\u2019s viewed as empowering. But, people have tried to ban the song Baby, It\u2019s Cold Outside for a man being aggressive. That is fair, but why is the former seen as different than the latter? It\u2019s the same action. I actually had a female college professor of mine talk about this song. She said that if the roles were reversed, it wouldn\u2019t be as bad. What? That absolutely baffles me. It also seems common to call men stupid or sex crazed when saying anything negative about women is seen as derogatory. Men often get blamed for their own problems instead of seen as societies misdeed. I really wish that we could break out of this idea that we live in an \u201coppressive patriarchy\u201d. Have women in the U.S. lacked rights in the past? Yes. But, men have faced issues as well. The Vietnam War comes to mind specifically. Men were shipped off to a foreign country (against their will) where they would either be killed or come back bearing horrible trauma. It has been that way for centuries as women only just recently started to become soldiers. Finally, when it comes to dating, men are often said to be dumb for not picking up on signals that women leave. Yet, every person is different and therefore will leave different signals. I think the problem arises from women not asking men out and men being expected to take the initiative. There\u2019s a lot more to it, but I think I\u2019ve said enough for now. I also want to make clear that I in no way intend to offend anyone. I simply want to state my thoughts and be able to express something I\u2019ve felt for a long time. And if my thoughts can benefit someone, I hope they can do that. Feel free to let me know what you think."

Bias, at it's foundation, means that your thoughts about something new are influenced by your prior thoughts (beliefs, opinions, knowledge, or choose your own synonym). That bias ends up causing what we call a liberal or a conservative bias, but the root is that past beliefs influence future reactions, decisions, etc. The only un-biased person is the newborn infant, just before it cries for the first time. After the doctor smacks its butt and it starts crying, all bets are off. After a little inductive reasoning, we get the answer to my questions: Yes.\n\nIf you just watch CNN and CNN Headline News, one perspective. Fox News, one perspective. Seeing many perspectives, let alone understanding them, requires effort. I find it mentally comfortable to watch opinions I agree with. Fortunately, I don't agree with most opinions so it's all equally uncomfortable. If you're not like me and find yourself agreeing with everything you watch, it's time to look to other sources to find the truth. But beware, if you read the \"Wall Street Journal\" and watch \"Fox News\", they're both owned by the Murdoch's so share perspective. Same would be true if you get all your news from NBC, CNBC and MSNBC. If you watch ABC, CBS, and NBC, they are not the same perspective because they compete, but they are very similar types of organizations so they will share foundational beliefs. They do not collude to say things that are verifiably untrue. Fox News makes a blatant attempt to be conservative, and they can lie because when refuted, they claim bias and their viewers believe them. The crucial question, Fox viewer: are you making your own decisions based on wide ranging and verifiable information, or just living in an echo chamber designed by somebody else for their own purposes?\n\n#semi\\_wild\\_cat"

Let me disregard a few.  \nPeople with EV cars are not all liberals. People with diesel cars are not all conservatives.  \nBeing a strong white man does not make give you \"White toxicity\".

        "original_selftext": "One day, we may turn Mother Nature into Daughter Nature, enveloping the biosphere with technology.\n\nSo, a while back I had an idea that I just can't stop thinking about, and to me it sounds oddly poetic. We've all heard of Mother Nature, and that name is typically used to describe nature (the biosphere, not the universe) as something outside of us, something that we're merely one part of, however with interstellar colonization, megastructures, self replicating machines, post biological life, genetic engineering and completely new exotic life, that *by definition* would no longer be true. Instead of Mother Nature taking us into her earthy embrace, we suddenly get *Daughter Nature*, clinging shyly to the dress of *Mother Technology*. The roles have reversed now, civilization no longer needs the, or really *any* biosphere, let alone the one we're familiar with.\n\nAnd even in the case of terraforming that implies us coming *before* nature and being the only thing really keeping it afloat for a very long time, and if it becomes self sustaining faster, it'll be because *we* helped it along. And even then such a civilization would outlive nature, out amongst the stars terraforming new planets which will one day wither and die without their masters keeping the ever growing flames of the stars at bay, and cradling their frail forms with warmth as the universe around them freezes over. And in reality it's even more imbalanced than that, *our technology itself* would be like a vastly superior ecosystem merging the best hits of evolution and innovation together to make technology so robust that *it's* the one overgrowing into the *ecosystems* after some apocalyptic scenario, not the other way around. Machines that can self replicate, repair, and work at every scale form nano to mega in one big \"fractalization\" of fully automated machinery that functions as a bodily reflex of post-biological human descendants that have full control over their minds and bodies. And technology could easily never malfunction either, there's already life that never ages or gets cancer, and while no organism is immune to sickness, having nanites basically means that by default as we could adapt exponentially faster than even the fastest mutations and just annihilate them eternally, always winning as we just adapt faster. And science can't go on forever, the universe is only so complex, eventually we will know every question that has a definitive answer and isn't just philosophical, and we'll have posed every philosophical question and possible answer out there, even if we can't test those hypotheses. And the completion of science (or at least reaching a point of vastly diminishing returns with only very minir adjustments occasionally made for new situations) should probably take no more than 10,000 years, perhaps even fewer than 1000. And everything for billions of lightyears can be ours, the stars themselves packed up into cold storage and brought back as a hoard of fuel to last us far longer than the death of the last stars would've been.\n\nAnd when there are ecosystems, they're made by our own hand, crafted with love and made in our image, countless forms of life that evolution could've never dreamed of, even on aliens worlds. Instead of humanity being but one species of millions in a planetary ecosystem billions of years old, we get an entire biosphere being just one little curious attraction among *trillions* of such experiments, and not particularly important to civilization as a whole, which is now more technology than biology, being able to shape themselves just as they shape the life around them. Human nature is no longer treated like a law of reality, it's just a design that can be changed at will, allowing us to advance morally, intellectually, and be better adapted to deep space where there is no greenery.\n\nHonestly, I think the most likely fate of Earth is not as a nature preserve, but a gigantic megastructual hub for most of humanity of tens of thousands of years to come, covered mostly in computronium for vast simulated worlds and unfathomable superintelligent minds, and swarmed by countless O'Neil Cylinders filled with various strains of life, ranging from the familiar, to the prehistoric, to the alien, to wacky creations straight out of fever dreams.\n\nNow, many people may say this is pure hubris, indeed many already have. However, although a bit of a philosophical tangent, the very idea of \"hubris\" is fundamentally flawed. Does ambition make one a bad person? Are there some ambitions that are just magically too big? How does one even draw the line of what's too arrogant to even think about trying? Is it still bad even if it's physically possible? Or if it both possible *and* proven to be beneficial? A good rule of thumb is that \"If it exists, we can understand, utilize, replicate, and improve upon it\". This rule is less common in physics as there's not much you can do to improve on fundamental particles and forces, indeed most particles are completely useless, but everything emerging from physics into more complex structures operates this way. If anything, nature is the thing we're *most* guaranteed to master, as it's a complex physical structure we can pick apart and study, not some abstract physical force like dark energy.\n\nNow, before you say \"But, nature is just the universe!\" I'm aware that definition tends to be used, but I'm taking the colloquial definition of nature as synonymous with the biosphere, specifically the one that has naturally evolved as opposed to being engineered by us through genetic interventions like selective breeding. For the other definition of nature, we're essentially the next phase, like the leap from prokaryotic to eukaryotic life, the thing which took billions of years to occur. Always remember, evolution is speeding up exponentially, progress is the number one rule of existence right now, the sentiment of \"there's nothing new under the sun\" died the moment the industrial revolution started, and truth be told it was never really true to begin with, now the reality is just undeniable.\n\n\"But isn't this all pure fantasy?\" No, not any more than any other speculation about the future, in fact it's vastly more grounded than most science fiction concepts like FTL. It operates entirely on the known laws of physics, and uses technologies we either have some primitive analog to, or can at least conceive of without any new physics. In fact, the Kardashev Scale alone is a quite grounded idea with wide scientific acceptance. And even very near-term technologies like climate-controlled arcologies, nuclear fusion, and hydroponics mean we're independent from nature by default, afterall there are no ecosystems in space, so the moment we can support a man throughout his entire life up in space, using only resources from space, the age of biosphere reliance has come to an end.\n\nAdditionally, I've considered renaming the concept to Grandmother Nature, as it seems a but more fitting, though Daughter Nature still makes more sense in the context of terraforming and artificial life.\n\nThis has definitely been a hot take everywhere else I post this. In short, nature is not something sacred or spiritual, it's just poorly designed machinery, machinery we can change in due time. And to those who say we should preserve nature, it doesn't even preserve itself! It's not harmonious or stable, and in truth it's unbelievably vicious. Not to mention, we don't even need actual nature psychologically, just some occasional greenery and nice parks, that's hardly \"natural\". To those who say nature is wise, it has even done exactly what we're doing now, creating pollution that nearly wiped out all life during the Great Oxygenation Event. And there's no logic behind wanting to preserve the exact environment we have now indefinitely, in fact that would be quite *unnatural* (not that that matters). To those who say nature is powerful, it's just a tiny coating of moss covering a fraction of a speck of dust, orbiting another speck of dust swirling around in the void. Technology could let us move beyond this tiny scale and take the whole damn galaxy and turn it into something beautiful. We could live to see the earth crumble to dust and blow away in the cosmic winds, or even disassemble it ourselves, or preserve it long after all the stars have died, maybe even preserving some modern ecosystems.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/EXTX1GLC5gg?si=ph8Lauw3LBC_YxPC Here's a video that's definitely adjacent to this idea and takes an overall supportive stance of it, but doesn't just shrug off the melancholy of it either."

Don\u2019t get me wrong as a gay man myself I used to think the same thing but I have since changed my mind\n\nthe fact is homophobia is an issue that many lgbt people deal with whether it\u2019s being bullied at school or having your family not accept you and even if you haven\u2019t directly experienced homophobia you\u2019ve likely heard people around you use homophobic slurs\n\nnow, is there room for lgbt characters to have struggles that are unrelated to their gender identity or sexual orientation? Of course but my point is that we can have it both and we should have both\n\nwhat do you guys think?"

        "original_selftext": "So I've been a big Spider-Man fanboy ever since I can remember, grew up with the Raimi movies and watched the first one so many times, that I can still recite the whole thing from start to finish. \n\nWith the great anticipation back in the day, before it came out, everyone was hyped and excited for the possibility of a real life adaptation of the Spider-Man multiverse. \n\nIn my opinion, Spider-Man NWH missed every opportunity to make the entrance of the other supervillains or Spider-Men epic and exciting. \n\nThe most disappointing moments were the \"return\" of both Andrews and Tobeys version of the heroes. Like, sure, that guy Ned just randomly has the power of magic and perfect use of the sling ring without any practice whatsoever. There was ZERO buildup to Neds abilities, which made the whole thing seem like a convenient way to make increase the pace of the movie, not like an exciting point in the development of Neds character or even the story. \n\nWhen looking at the Villains, yeah the green goblin was cool, because Willem Dafoe is a incredible actor. Doc Ock is also cool at first, but his powers, along with his menacing aura was taken away from him way too soon. Both these guys are just actors of a different caliber, but not only can you see the contrast between them and the rest of the cast, they weren\u2019t really given the opportunity and atmosphere they deserved to make these iconic characters shine. \n\nAs far as the others are concerned? The Lizard looks like an action figure, the Sandman looked a LOT worse than in Spider-Man 3, and Electro turned from a whacky minded, insane character who is hungry for his newly gained power\u2026.into a cool as fuck black dude who\u2019s got insane swag. Like seriously, it felt like there was probably a moment where the directors were yelling at Jamie Foxx: \"MAKE IT MORE BLACK\" lmao\nIn my opinion, all of these 3 characters were completely robbed of the character they had in the movies of which they originated from. \n\nThere are so many points in this movie that were just plainly - anticlimactic and rushed. The movie feels like they had to finally get it out and nothing more. \n\n"
