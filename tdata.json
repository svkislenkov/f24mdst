        "author": "341orbust",
        "selftext": "The first Gen Viper was relatively more affordable and a more radical departure from daily driver performance than previous factory hot rods. \n\nLet me 'splain. \n\nWhat was the average person driving in 1995? A fwd econobox with ~150-220 horsepower, a 4-speed auto, 205 or 215 series 16\" tires, airbags, abs, collapsible steering wheel, shoulder belts, etc- slow, safe, and predictable. \n\nThe best selling car in 1995 was the Taurus- dead center on all those stats. \n\n1995 Viper? 400 horsepower, RWD, 6-speed manual, summer compound 275/40R17 front / 335/35R17 rear tires, no abs, no traction control, etc. \n\nThe Viper cost ~1.35 times the average MSRP of a new car in 1985.\n\nNow, let's look at the apex of factory hot rods at the apex of the 1960s horsepower war- the 1969 ZL-1 Corvette. \n\nWhile there was a much larger range of engine (and therefore horsepower) options in 1969, the average car in 1969 had lap belts and no other safety features, a 6 or 8 cylinder with 150-225 horsepower, 205-215 width 14 or 15\" tires, and a 3 speed auto or 3-4 speed manual. \n\n1969 ZL-1 'Vette? ~450 horsepower, lap belts and nothing else, 225 width 15\" tires, and a 4 speed manual. \n\nThe ZL-1 cost ~1.75 times the average MSRP of a new car in 1969. \n\nNow, sure, there's a lot of variability here, but the basics are obvious: while both the Viper and the ZL-1 (or GT500, or Hemi 'Cuda, or COPO Camaro) roughly double the horsepower of the average family car in their day, the Viper has far fewer safety measures, a far greater performance envelope, and is far more affordable to the average dentist than a late '60s supercar. \n\nIf you bolted the ZL-1's polyglas Goodyears onto a 1969 SS350 Camaro it wouldn't really change the look or performance. \n\nPut 275ZR17 summer tires on a '95 Taurus and see what happens. \n\nIn conclusion: if you stepped from a 383 RoadRunner (300 or so hp) into a ZL-1 (~475 hp) in 1969 you spent more money and generated more tire smoke, but your performance and handling weren't radically different and you already expected your daily driver to try to kill you.\n\nIf you stepped from a 1995 Supra (with 300 hp) into a Viper you got a car that was radically more capable with far fewer electronic nannies. \n\nBecause the Viper was (comparably) much more affordable to the average buyer in 1995, more realistically you were stepping from a ~250 hp Camaro, Porsche, or BMW with ABS and traction control into a 400 hp Viper with none of those things. \n\nSo, like I said, the Viper was purchased and driven by people with the wrong expectations in a way late 60's monsters weren't.

        "author": "Coffee-and-puts",
        "selftext": "In the mortgage industry, all lenders have the vast majority of their loans insured by FHA, VA, FNMA or FHLMC. \n\nIn 2019, the loan limit was set to $484,350. Then in 2020 it crossed into $510,400. \n\nAt the end of this year and currently for many lenders, the limit just shifted up to $802,650 which is a 65% increase in just 5 years. \n\nNow whats interesting here is that from 2006-2016, the loan limit remained at 417,000. The average price of a home from 2006-2016 went from 247,700 to 311,00 over a decade for a 25% increase. \n\nAt the start of 2019 the average home was 313,000 and today sits around 412,000 which is a 32% increase in half the time. \n\nThere is a notable upswing from 2020 to just 2022 where a home was 329,000 to 437,700 and thats a 33% increase in just 2 years. \n\nLong of the short, housing is rising abnormally fast and the govt whom sets these limits has done nothing but encourage higher prices. \n\nIf loan limits were still back at the 500k level, we simply wouldn\u2019t see the pace of value increase so incredibly. You may want to sell your home for some egregious number, but good luck finding a buyer. Its this rolling of limits up that is the root problem of housing being so expensive. \n\nLenders specifically don\u2019t lend their own money, but the govt\u2019s money. If the loan forecloses, your bank takes no hit at all, but the govt pays them out. Mortgage insurance/PMI exists specifically to help the govt recoup forclosed property and payouts to lenders. \n\nEveryone talks about all these solutions to the craziness that is the housing market, but its as simple as the govt not blindly raising limits. One may say that this would price regular people out of loans, but this is false as the lenders wouldn\u2019t bother lending their own money anyways. Home would *have* to stay cheaper to accommodate demand. Thus the fix is much simpler than everyone makes it out to be. Stop raising these dam limits and all of a sudden people will be able to afford homes again. ",

It\u2019s overrated and very unhealthy.\n\nLet\u2019s get to the point, I think that the flavors and ingredients are incredibly bland. They only use the same boring toppings: lettuce, corn, cheese, and beans, putting beans and corn into a meal doesn\u2019t make it exotic. \n\nEverywhere I see people claiming that mexican \u201ccuisine\u201d is so flavorful and delicious when imo it is among the worst variety of food, closely resembling indian food in many ways. The ingredients will give you stomach pains as it is pretty much inedible. Large amounts of low quality oil, abundance of organ fattening corn mix, and dirty crops from mexican fields.\n\nFrom what I\u2019ve overheard in the hospital, the Mexicans can\u2019t even enjoy their own food. Supposedly everyone in the family must go to the hospital atleast once a month for digestion and prolapse issues. If they can\u2019t even consume the stuff they\u2019ve been peddling out for years, why are we eating it and telling ourselves we enjoy it??\n\n\nIf you\u2019re someone that doesn\u2019t blindly follow the general population, i would recommend avoiding mexican food/crops. A much tastier option imo would be Peruvian food, it\u2019s much higher in quality and has true flavor and differing recipes, plus they actually put care into making the food.\n\nSo yeah, I think mexican food is terrible for their bland unhealthy ingredients, and I\u2019m tired of seeing people trying to push this crap food online and irl",

        "selftext": "Bias as an avoidant (or fearful avoidant) \u2014 it\u2019s really annoying to see all these reels about attachment styles and the amount of vilifying against the avoidant and the victimhood label to the anxious. I feel it\u2019s the opposite, spoken as someone who has trauma responses when it comes to people being demanding/making demands. And needing my constant attention, validation, or presence or whatever is making demands. And that\u2019s what it feels like the anxious partner needs, attention and I get that. But you needing attention is not more important than my sense of safety and wellbeing. \n\nThere are a few reasons why I need to pull back and why I start to become distant or avoid. I grew up in a home where I couldn\u2019t say no, I couldn\u2019t fight back, I couldn\u2019t run, and I couldn\u2019t defend myself because that only made it last longer and it only made it worse. I dated someone who had the same exact mentality for over a decade. \n\nI don\u2019t know how to say no and being put in situations where I have to say no or go along with something I don\u2019t want to, I either just go along with it begrudgingly or if I can avoid it, I just avoid it. I have no idea what the response is gonna be if I say no. Doesn\u2019t matter who it is I\u2019m saying no to. \n\nSaying no to someone\u2019s face is a lot worse when you have to compose yourself in front of them. \n\nIf over the phone or through a message I say no, I almost immediately close the app or go on airplane mode or DND because I can\u2019t see their response. If they do react fine, fine. But if they press, that\u2019s just gonna restart a whole other hour or more of hyping myself up to say no again. \n\nI have a lot of anxious attached friends and I try to be there for them when I can be and according to them, I do a good job being there. But why would it be on me needing time for myself just because the anxious attached has codependency issues? \n\nI can\u2019t stand people clinging to me. It\u2019s not just suffocating, it feels controlling, parasitic, and abusive. Nobody needs to talk every single minute of every single day. Nobody needs to talk every single day even. \n\nSince when is causing someone psychological harm less damning than I guess hurting someone\u2019s feelings because you needed to step away and take care of yourself??? \n\n\u201cOh, but talk to me. Don\u2019t avoid or distance yourself.\u201d\n\nNot everyone is entitled for someone to open up to them and besides, maybe you can\u2019t hold space for them, maybe you\u2019re too self interested in your own needs, or maybe it\u2019s outside your scope or your ability. \n\n(This isn\u2019t about long term relationships/serious relationships.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "selftext": "Many people online are arguring which one are the most important or the best for the culture, society or country to run some people are sided with collectivism and the others individualism. People on both sides think that collectivism and individualism are mutually exclusive. It goes like this for people who sided with collectivism thinks that if collectivism works in the culture the results will be that the country or society have harmony, social cohesion, be clean interdependence and much more but it will hamper creativity, uniqueness, individual thoughts, innovation and much more. On the other hand, people who sided with individidualism thinks that if individidualism works in the culture the country or society will have creativity, high GDP, innovation, high intellegence and much more but it will hamper, social cohesion, it will have conflicts, the country and cities will be dirty, no teamwork and much more.\u00a0\n\nPeople who sided with collectivism and others who sided with individualism are arguring by giving out reasons why they choose their side.\n\nPeople who sided with collectivism against individualism will say:\n\n\u201cCollectivism is better because it\u2019ll make the country and society be clean, have no conflicts, harmony and much more. While individualism is bad because it\u2019ll make the country and society have conflicts, be dirty, no public property, selfishness and much more. That\u2019s why there are countries and cities that are clean, have selfless people and much more because they value collectivism since it\u2019s superior while individualism is bad for the country and society.\u201d\n\nPeople who sided with individualism against collectivism will say:\n\n\u201cScrew that, individualism is better because it\u2019ll make the country and society have creativity, high GDP, innovation, privacy and much more. While collectivism is bad because it\u2019ll make the country and society have no creativity,\u00a0\u00a0low GDP, no innovation, lack of privacy and much more. This is why America especially hollywood and the UK are big at making movies and tv shows because they value individualism which includes creativity. Germany made advanced technologies because individualism is better which includes innovation. While collectivism is bad for the country and society.\u201d\n\nThis argument is getting out of hand and getting so much debate and it needs to stop because in reality, collectivism and individualism are not mutually exclusive they co exist at the same time within all countries and societies and also these two are not the only reasons why there are countries and societies that are clean, creative, innovative, have harmony, high GDP and much more. It goes like this:\n\n1. America is being proclaimed as Individualistic but in scenarios like construction sites and road work, teamwork is required because it needs a lot of people to build and work there which teamwork is a key point of collectivism, so therefore collectivistic culture exist in America. (Personally it\u2019s safe me to say, America is a collectivistic country or society.)\n2. South Korea is being proclaimed as Collectivstic but in scenarios like making technologies, innovation is required because they want to make technologies advanced and innovative which innovation is a key point of Individualism, so therefore individualistic culture exist there in South Korea.\n3. Sweden is also being proclaimed as Individualistic but the country is also clean and it\u2019s either because of different aspect of culture or policies. So therefore, individualism does not automatically mean the country will be dirty which people think that it\u2019ll make the country dirty but it\u2019s untrue.\n4. Japan is also being proclaimed as collectivism but in scenarios like making video games, anime, TV shows and movies, creativity is required because they want to make these things so creative which creativity is a key point of individualism, so therefore individualism culture exist in Japan.\n\nSo these are the countries I point out that you need to understand that collectivism and individualism are not mutually exclusive but they co exist at the same time even in many countries that are proclaimed as collectivistic and other proclaimed as individualistic. You also gotta understand that collectivism and individualism are not the only reasons why countries and societies are clean, have creativity, innovation, people who wants privacy, high GDP and much more.",

To me it is the execution of the story which matters. Is it entertaining, is it well made with interesting characters, good cinematography and an exciting and interesting story? If yes, I don't care that if it is the 100th iteration of the same old trope.\n\nLet's be honest, is there any story that is really 100% original. Everything which can be said or told has already been said or told. We can vary these old stories, give them new interesting twists and it will be a masterpiece.\n\nA new \"original\" story with truly new ideas is not automatically good. If the story is boring, bland and poorly made it will not be saved by its originality. Often it is quite the opposite where the novelty is the only aspect that makes a story notable, but the lack in execution kills it.\n\nI would rather have the 10 millionth adaptation of Snow White if it is well made and interesting than this new flashy epic tale that falls flat on its nose.\n\nAn example is the anime series \"Darling in the Franxx\" which gets lots of hate for various reason, one of them being that it is said to be a rip-off of \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\". I personally loved the show despite thinking that some of the criticisms have some reason, but that DitF is an Evangelion rip-off is none of them. Yes, it has many elements that are heavily inspired from the other show, but it does not take away from its qualities. It is its own story with interesting characters and great developments.

        "selftext": "Throughout my life, I never understood why the song 'Bohemian Rhapsody' was such a big deal, until I listened to it for the first time somewhere in the 6th grade. For the first two minutes, I thought it was pretty good. Such dark lyrics, and a great guitar riff.\n\nUnfortunately, my excitement went away when it got to the \"Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?\" part. I don't remember how I reacted to it, but it really took me out of the song. When the song finally ended, I got confused. Is 'Bohemian Rhapsody' one song? Or three songs? And why did the tone change all of a sudden?\n\nAfter I finished, I never listened to it again. I would hear the song on occasions whether I'd be in an area where music is played on the speakers, or whenever one of my school teachers would play music. As I grew older, I began to not hate it as much, but when I would listen to the song, I would only play the ballad part.\n\nIt's now 2024, and I still only listen to the ballad part (+ the ending \"nothing really matters\" lyrics. 'Cause why not). Funny enough, I've listened to fan-edited versions of the song on YouTube (where it's just the ballad) more than the actual official upload.\n\nBefore anyone comes up with any conclusions, let me settle the deal. Just because I'm not a fan of 'Bohemian Rhapsody'. that doesn't mean I don't like 'Queen'. In fact, one of my favorite songs of all time is a Queen song (It's A Kind Of Magic). I just think that their most popular song is weirdly structured, changes tone too quickly, and it's quite bizarre. This is where I give my props to Queen, as for their Live Aid performance, they only played the ballad. Although, I have to assume that they didn't play the rest of the song because of the time-limit each performer of the concert had.\n\nStrangely, however. I did eventually find the second half of the song to be slightly better when it's performed live. I'm not a fan of the original studio version, but I did find myself like the second half more in life performances, and i guess it's because it feels more like a transition to song, and it has more fan interaction.\n\nAnyways, that is my unpopular opinion.",

Any more than that and you\u2019re screwing up your workout/pace.\n\nI do think the added safety especially for females is a positive - however but the experience described previously remains the same.",

        "author": "schuldinersleftball",
        "selftext": "A work of art, whatever media it is presented in, should be able to hold its own regardless of comparisons to the source material. That statement is somewhat widely accepted and has been true in many cases, especially ones where the source isn't universally accepted as a masterpiece, but the adaptation turned out to be - famous examples are The Shining and The Godfather.\n\nHowever, there is a general expectation from the audience that an adaptation will be at least 80% (arbitrary number) similar to the original. It means that a  Lord of the Rings adaptation with dinosaur robots would be immediately rejected by the general audience because it's so drastic a departure that it doesn't make the cut.\n\nI on the other hand think adaptations should do exactly that. Not only transpose the media format because this is usually, not always of course, just a money grab. A big corporation picks a successful video game and turns it into a movie. Or a book into a video game. Or a movie into a board game. All that by telling the exact same story we are already familiar with. What's to be gained by the audience when we already know the story to begin with?\n\nAn example of a departure that I appreciate, though it's not that radical since much of the original is kept, is the first Full Metal Alchemist anime. Brotherhood may be the better story, but in terms of adaptation the first anime beats it by a large margin for me. I'll not spoil the end but that's totally mind blowing. They also change a lot of characters, introduce new ones and completely remove others. I always appreciated when HBO's Game of Thrones changed characters radically like that too.\n\nBut the above is very simple. I'd like to see, like I said, a LOTR movie with robots. I'd like a movie adaption of The Book Thief that takes place not in Nazi Germany, but in Aztec Mexico. Give me a Kill Bill video game where Beatrix is an otter in Mars. Or a series of BioShock books that takes place during the paleolithic. How? I don't know, I'm just a spectator. Make it work. Just don't make me go through the same story over and over again.\n\n(Please don't \"don't like, don't watch/play/read\" me. You are all better than that!)",

        "author": "TrentTompkins",
        "selftext": "It seems screwed up that someone who is dead would want to let several other people suffer and/or die, just so they could keep their (soon to be rotting) organs inside their corpse. It would be like putting in your will that you wanted your house bulldozed and all your possessions buried with you. I'm an organ donor, and think everyone should just be assumed to be by default. If you don't want to be an organ donor, I think it's ultimately your choice to opt out, but opting  out should mean you can't receive other people's organs either (at least not from the \"public\" pool, if a relative or something wants to give you specifically their organ, that's different). It seems crazy that people die for lack of organs - 100,000 are dying every year just from fentanyl, that's 100,000 hearts, 200,000 kidneys, 200,000 corneas, ECT. I think the \"shortage\" of organs is because of a bad \"opt in\" policy designed to cut healthcare costs. After all, a heart transplant can cost several hundred thousand dollars plus thousands more for anti rejection drugs; one dead overdose victim could put insurer's on the hook for 3 million dollars worth of organ transplants, IF he's an organ donor. But if he didn't check a box on his driver's license application? That's 3 million saved. So surprise, there's \"not enough\" organs. But, there's plenty to bury in the ground or cremate. I guarantee if organ donors were paid there would be enough organs. If a hospital bills $400,000 for a kidney transplant, why shouldn't the donors family get $20,000, or $50,000? Not enough that people are going to be killing themselves to get their family out of debt, but enough to pay for a nice funeral and a few months off work. I'd love it if I died and my dad got $100,000 check - \"here, your son wasn't a piece of shit, he let his organs save 3 people. Guess he figured he wouldn't need them AFTER HE WAS DEAD.\"\n\nThe only legitimate reasons I can see to not donate your organs:\n1) your an Egyptian Pharoh and need them in your pyramid for the afterlife\n2) you are signed up for cryonics and don't want the hospital to screw up freezing you because they are trying to cut you apart.\n",

If you were to just give me unseasoned chicken, fish, steak, or lamb, it might be alright if it\u2019s cooked really well but it isn\u2019t complete. You need to add salt or pepper for these to be delicious as a bare minimum. Oysters however all have unique flavours being perfectly seasoned naturally just from the water they\u2019re in or their species. You could pick an oyster and just shuck it right there and eat it. No seasonings, nothing. Yeah a steak with butter, salt, pepper, and aromatics might be better than the best oyster available even prepared the best way possible, but it is not better without seasonings or other ingredients. I do love plain raw salmon or tuna with no seasonings but they are not nearly as complex with oysters.",

But I've just really never understood the point.\n\nI understand that every school is different, but in my high school it always seemed like school spirit was just a tactic by the administration to distract us from our school's problems. Sure, our school can't go a year without someone killing themselves, but let's focus on the big homecoming game against Smallville instead! I understand why the school wants to create  a strong sense of community, but if you want students to take pride in the school, then actually try to fix the issues instead of sweeping them under the carpet.\n\nEven without taking that into consideration though, it just seems pointless. I don't go to school to go to football games or dances, I go to school to learn. That's it. The whole point of school is that you leave at some point. So why form an emotional connection to a place that you're only going to be in for four years? \n\nCollege is a little different. I understand why people have more connections to college: a) they actually choose to go there, b) they most likely lived on the campus at some point, so it was basically a second home, and c) the friendships you make in college are a lot more stronger than the ones you make in high-school. But it still seems kind of pointless. You go to college to learn skills that will get you your ideal career. If you're just watching football and going to parties, you're in college for all the wrong reasons. \n\nTL;DR - A school is a vehicle for education. That's it. The purpose of school is to meet all the requirements, then move on. There is literally no reason for you to have an emotional attachment to your school. The only people I've met that have school spirit are the people that wish they could say in high school/college forever. And if you feel that way, you've done something very wrong.",

All in all, radio announcers are routinely awful listens and   ruin your experience listening to the game when you have to listen to it on the radio/radio stream. \n\nWhat's worse is that they are extremely good at the actual craft of broadcasting. They often do a remarkable job of painting a picture of what is happening on the field/ice - so you can see the ability is there - but they can't resist acting like blithering fools during a broadcast: yelling, ignoring whenever the opponent does anything well, not admitting they were wrong when replays or rules say they are, saying \"we/us/our\" etc. \n\nOne caveat: this does not apply to New York City or Los Angeles sports teams. Those guys are super professional and while they obviously get MORE excited when the home team succeeds they aren't completely disinterested or dispassionate when the opponent does something well. The further you get away from NYC/LA, the worse it gets. The Tampa Bay Lightning have the worst I have ever heard.

Constant bleeding, no matter how \u201chard\u201d I tried the razor would always result in several cuts around the neck area .\n\n2. It left me with a stubble, always.\n\nI tried putting more force , and still nothing really changed , a tip I found was \u201cgo against the grain\u201d and still nothing helped .\n\nAnd for me this is the most important :\n\n3. It made my shaving time go from 10 minutes to 1 hour minimum, I had to \u201cprepare\u201d my face with hot water towel for 5-10 minutes so that I don\u2019t get irritations , then during the shaving process I had to be extra careful so that I don\u2019t cut myself and it meant more time and slower progress.\n\n4. I couldn\u2019t shave my until 5 days later , this is due to irritation and the neck area specifically gets very sensitive 1-2 days after shaving .\n\n\nNow what I did was pretty much buy a quality modern 3 razor blade razor (80$) and came with 8 razor heads .\n\nMy time to shave went back to 10 minutes, now shaving is easier , better and I can honestly say the modern razor does not irritate my face while still providing a close to edge shave , something that was lacking in the double edged razor .\n\nI also shave weekly with no \u201cfear\u201d of cuts or insane amounts of preparations.\n\n\nI\u2019m putting this because don\u2019t believe everything you see on the internet, regardless how much \u201cauthentic\u201d it seems \n\nTLDR : Tried the double-edged razor hype for 3 months\u2014constant cuts, stubble, and hour-long shaves.

Underneath the surface all it boils down to is doing work and making money for someone else,  yet people will go into massive debts or years of sleepless nights in the pursuit of it. Those same people might even decry the thought of taking on the responsibility of parenthood, and oftentimes use that effort they put into making money for someone else as a reason why not to have kids. \n\nLike I've heard about students putting in massive hours and again, sleepless nights for months on end. If you're a medical student it'll likely be years before you are stable. If you're in the trades you could get permanently injured or have no time for yourself. If you get a high degree you might not have a much money as others in your age group due to student loan debt. If you're in a field that involves caringfor others then a mistake could cost someone else dearly or you might not even be situated for the work and now that effort you put in is fundamentally wasted. You then work until either you die early or can save enough to retire all old and less invigorated than when you were younger.  \n\nAsk them about kids though and those exact same reasons become the very reasons why they won't have any, lack of time,  the commitment for years, the sleepless nights, the short on money, maybe you won't be happy, maybe you'll make a mistake... these are all somwhow unacceptable sacrifices for kids but when it comes to fattening your employer's wallet everyone wants to fall all over themselves biting for that carrot. This is totally fucking backwards and as a society we need to put less importance on how someone makes their money and more importance on how they spend their time living the life they are striving for.",

        "selftext": "I'm not sure if this is 100% on point for this subreddit, since this is more of a niche opinion that no one would hold, rather than an unpopular opinion that everyone disagrees with. Regardless, considering how often we see this shit in EVERY FUCKING TV SHOW, I imagine there's an audience for it\n\nI love medieval times, and I love fantasy. I'll gladly watch game of thrones, house of the dragon ,Last Kingdom, even Vikings TV (even it's just a hate watch). Braveheart, Joan of Arc: The Messenger, Outlaw King, The King, the Witcher, a Knight's Tale. If you can name a medieval movie or TV show, or medieval-adjacent, chances are I've watched it.\n\nBut one thing I can't stand is the \"battle\" scenes in these medias. There is literally nothing more unenjoyable than watching a famous actor in a ridiculous costume swing a prop at a bunch of extras. There's nothing to be gained by watching this. Like, do any of you actually think that a main character played by a famous actor is going to die to some faceless, nameless actor? There's no stakes, there's nothing that's being communicated to the audience. In fact sometimes the stakes are so low that the extras aren't even shown on screen; the main character just swings a sword, a shot of blood comes from off-camera, and then it cuts to a different shot.\n\nThere's needs to be some actual depth to these scenes. A lot of people really hated Alexander starring Collin Farrel, and TBH so did I because it was really boring, but Alexander was one of the few movies that tried to depict formation warfare. Men keeping ranks, battlefield maneuvers, authentic equipment and tactics, the whole 9 yards. That's why Alexander, an otherwise boring and overly long movie, is redeemed by the battle scenes. On the other hand, a super interesting TV show like Game of Thrones is made worse by the battle scenes. Did any one actually think The Long Night was worth watching? A bunch of CGI monsters on a pitch dark screen? Who gives a shit? Just skip to the end.\n\n If it was more common that main characters died randomly on the battlefield (as it happened in real life), then there would be more stakes involved and thus the audience could be more engaged. The Last Kingdom is the only media that I can think of that actually does this, since important characters (even main characters) die to unnamed randoms in a few of their battles. Except TLK does everything else wrong; the battle scenes are way too long, there's no logic, it's just a chaotic mess of shaky cam and dead extras. As much as I love TLK, I always skip the battle scenes.\n\nOne last point to make; it's funny that the peak seasons of GOT skipped over the battles. There was always a cut-away and it happened off-screen. That was because they didn't have the budget, but it just goes to show that the strengths of a show like GOT wasn't the battles, because when the battles started being shown, the show got markedly worse and more poorly received.\n\nAnd BTW one-on-one duels are a different story; sometimes they're good, sometimes they make the same mistakes as big battles. Just a chaotic mess with no logic.",

        "author": "Galvantic_",
        "selftext": "This is one of my opinions that always gets me into arguments with my friends, so I thought it could be another interesting post here. I just want to clarify that I am NOT a Mario hater. Mario games are fantastic - I have probably played through the Super Mario Galaxy about 100 times, and I always find myself playing older Mario Kart games and living out the glory days from when I was younger. BUT, I am not considering Mario Kart or Mario Party or Paper Mario or any of those things in the argument. After all, I am talking about Super Mario, and the other franchises are spin-offs. This is simply Super Mario Bros. through Super Mario Bros. Wonder.\n\nALSO - this is not like the Roblox vs. Minecraft post that got me hate because they do not really compare - these are two directly comparable video games an franchises. They are both Nintendo-made, 2D platformers in creative worlds and simplistic, clean, and child-friendly graphics. They are VERY similar franchises... if you can't compare these two franchises, you can't compare anything, and I would see that argument as a bit of a cop-out and way to avoid what I'm actually saying.\n\nFirstly, I am a guy that loves a bit of lore in my games. That is not the end-all and be-all for me, but I do love lore. And, let's be honest, Mario is lacking in that regard. IT's NOT SUPPOSED TO! I understand that it is not the franchise to go to if you want lore. But, in my opinion (which is what this subreddit is for), the lore just sucks. Meanwhile, Kirby lore is a lot more interesting. He literally kills gods on the regular, and the existence of those gods is just really interesting to me. The Paper Mario and Mario and Mario and luigi franchises all have good lore, but like I said, this is not the same thing as Super Mario so I'm just talking about those.\n\nKirby also takes a lot more risks with their games. With Mario, they have a formula that just really works for them. Look at New Super Mario Bros. then New Super Mario Bros. Wii, then 2 and U. They are all basically the same game. Same for 3D Mario. 64 is very similar to Sunshine, Galaxy, Odyssey. And then 3D land and World are just 3D versions of New Super. With Kirby, they take SO MANY RISKS. Look at epic yarn, planet robobot, forgotten land. They might not always work out, but they TAKE THE RISKS. With Mario games, any \"risk\" just goes to be a spinoff, so the main series stays incredibly stagnant. With Kirby, they try and fail and try again and SUCCEED and that is just the passion for game design I really enjoy.\n\nQuick sidebar, but the art is just better in Kirby too - everything is so much more appealing and interesting to look at. With Mario, it's like they can't always decide between realism and cartoony (Odyssey vs. Wonder, recently!) and it ends up just being a weird, messier art style. With Kirby, they are absolutely killing it and everything is so charming. Good example of that is Star Allies!\n\nThere's also puzzles and strategizing in the games. With Mario games, you generally run to the right and do that until you win. With Kirby games, you have more abilities to decide between and there are just more things you have to figure out along the way.\n\nAnd my HOTTEST take (probably shouldn't open this can of worms at all, but here we go!), I think Kirby music clears Mario music.

On the topic of allergies, for example, in a study conducted within Britain in 1990s, 20% of people believed they suffered from allergies, but fewer than 2% actually reacted negatively to a formal skin test ([https://www.news24.com/life/wellness/body/condition-centres/allergy/about-allergy/what-if-your-allergies-were-all-in-your-head-20190511-2](https://www.news24.com/life/wellness/body/condition-centres/allergy/about-allergy/what-if-your-allergies-were-all-in-your-head-20190511-2))\n\nIn a similar study conducted in the United States, roughly 20% of US adults claimed to suffer from allergies, but only 10% actually did ([https://www.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2018.5630](https://www.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2018.5630))\n\nIn a survey of 1,000 people, approximately 25% of people admitted to self-diagnosing themselves with a mental illness, with the rate jumping up to 30% when considering Gen-Z alone, with anxiety and depression being the most common. Of those people, only 43% actually sought a medical opinion, meaning a shocking 56% of people are going around believing they have some sort of mental affliction, without any actual evidence or diagnosis to support that claim ([https://www.tebra.com/theintake/medical-deep-dives/tips-and-trends/is-self-diagnosis-on-social-media-helping-or-hurting-peoples-health](https://www.tebra.com/theintake/medical-deep-dives/tips-and-trends/is-self-diagnosis-on-social-media-helping-or-hurting-peoples-health))\n\n**Why Is It A Problem?**\n\nMedical conditions are inherently uncomfortable to talk about. If someone is genuinely suffering from something like anxiety or depression, any sane person would not want to put undue pressure on someone that might exacerbate these conditions.\n\nHowever, with the rise of self-diagnosis,\u00a0*anybody*\u00a0can claim they suffer from\u00a0*anything,*\u00a0and use that as a justification to fail to meet their responsibilities, exert control over others, or claim they're being treated in unfair manner because of a supposed 'medical condition'.\n\nNowadays, somebody can claim they have a scent-related sensitivity, and use that as a justification to tell other people the soap, shampoo, and deodorant they're allowed to use. People have weaponized the idea that it's impolite (or illegal, in some places) to ask about medical conditions, and are literally using that to exert control over others.\n\nSomeone who is unhappy with the conditions of their life can claim that they're 'depressed', and not have to critically take a look at their own shortcomings and actions that have led to their current position. If one truly believes they are suffering from clinical depression, which is a genuine and horrible condition, shouldn't they seek to rectify that through medical care?\n\nInstead, increasingly you're seeing people use 'depression' as an excuse for not putting in an effort into their own lives, social anxiety as an excuse to not do normal things (like some people claim they'll shit their pants if they talk to someone on the phone?) and allergies to justify having the palate of a 10-year-old.\n\nAnecdotally speaking, as someone who's been in a position where I've hired people for about 15 years, I've definitely noticed an uptick in the last five or ten years of those who are just unwilling to be put in uncomfortable situations, and will use every excuse under the sun to justify why that's okay. Nobody is born a salesman, manager, or financier, they have\u00a0*developed*\u00a0those skills through\u00a0*experiences.*\u00a0New experiences are\u00a0*inherently*\u00a0uncomfortable, but that is how you\u00a0*grow*.\n\nThat goes for every facet of life, by the way. There is a breadth of cultures, cuisines, nations and experiences to be had in this wonderful world, and it's incredibly unfortunate that so many people will never have the opportunity to experience these things as a result of some bullshit they read on social media, or that they've convinced themselves they have clinical anxiety (when in reality, almost everyone has some sort of discomfort in unfamiliar situations, that is NOT what anxiety is!)\n\nPeople are essentially kneecapping their personal development and growth by pathologizing every facet of their lives. We're going to have an entire generation with this victim complex, where they have just convinced themselves that the reason their life sucks is because of some affliction they suffer from, when in all likelihood they probably don't.",

This is stupid and horrible and would never work!\u201d\n\nDo you honestly think the footage wouldn\u2019t be reviewed in court? Obviously a court would look at the recording and see, clearly, whether you were/weren\u2019t intending to record *the people suing you* rather than your family/friends/people who consented, so the verdict would be applied accordingly, and the people taking you to court might have just wasted a ton of money on court expenses if they just tried to sue you on unreasonable grounds.\n\nSo no, this would not be some crazy issue that prevents you from recording regular, consensual moments in your life.\n\n> \u201cWhat if there\u2019s someone performing in public??\u201d\n\nThis would likely be an exception as they\u2019re clearly performing in public ***for*** views. I think it would be unreasonable to expect a public performer to *not* want to be seen by as many people as possible, so unless they have a sign up, this would be okay. Even then though, if the sign is clearly obscured in a video, you\u2019re not going to be getting in any trouble for that.\n\n##Edit: If you don\u2019t think specific exceptions and guidelines like the above can exist for legal matters, literally just look at the free speech right, which has many exceptions to what actually gets protected by free speech (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_free_speech_exceptions)\n\n> \u201cDash cams?

        "selftext": "As a relatively new fan to Persona 3 (I got into it in 2023, just before the remake was announced), I was really excited for Episode Aigis. Yes, I get that the price was egregious, yes I knew that I was supporting bad business practices. However, I felt that I could forgo that because, I thought a brand new dungeon+story was well-worth the asking price (at the time...) because I adored the base-game and wanted to see how they handled The Answer.\n\nAnd then I played it, and good lord did that buyer's remorse hit hard...\n\nFirst of all, even though the Compendium is , the combat is just as grindy. They really should've tried reducing the number of floors.\n\nA lot of the cutscenes were kinda toned down. The most egregious one was the one where the MC dissolves.\n\nAll the above points are annoying, but I can excuse them\n\nWhat I cannot excuse is what they did with Yukari's breakdown after the Colosseum fight.\n\nFor some reason, unlike the FES version, Yukari doesn't forcibly try to take the true key from Aigis. Like her entire character arc in the Answer relied on that one scene and the writers took it out?? And for what?? I've heard some people claim that this was because of the backlash that Yukari received in the original, which makes sense at first, but if you really think about it, why then would they make Yukari so stand-offish in the first place?\n\nIn Reload, she still forces the team to split up, forcing them to fight in the Colosseum. So people who disliked her for being bitchy are still gonna dislike her. And Yukari fans obviously dislike this change to her characters. Hell even newer fans would seem confused by how abruptly Yukari gave up the keys. So this change pleases NOBODY.\n\nThis is so frustrating because P3R is the most current and accessible version of the story, both because of its reduced difficulty and the fact that it's on current consoles + Steam. So the fact that they neutered the impact of the story so much is aggravating.\n\nIf any newcomer to P3 is reading and ignored all my spoiler warnings for some reason, I'd recommend just emulating P3FES on PCSX2 instead. You can select to just play the Answer and not have to d3eal with the Journey al over again. You'll get a much better version of the story that way, even if the tactics system might no be for you, I'd suggest giving it a chance. Don't buy Episode Aigis. Don't even pirate it.",

Most of the cases of this are middle income people overspending on luxuries rather than lower income people, but even that is more rare than you think it would be. Most of this sentiment comes from out of touch middle or upper income people. \n\nIf you've ever actually talked to or been in the presense of a poor person (or been one yourself) you know just how good they are on average at money management. They have to be to survive. There is no way that (for example) someone in the United States is going to live off a minimum wage income and still having a roof over their head if they aren't going to find creative ways to save money\n\nWhen richer people try to lecture poor people, it always comes off as the apprentice trying to lecture the expert. Their skills are probably vastly superior to yours, and they are already 10 steps ahead of any suggestion you give.\n\nFor example, you have basic money management. The shit that everyone from at least a middle income background learns, than you have the level of money management skills that your average r/redneckengineering poster has. They are in completely different leagues, like comparing the skills of a casual Counter-Strike player to a professional one. The r/redneckengineering poster can find ways to save money that you wouldn't even think about until they mentioned it to you, and that is basically your average poor person. \n\nRich people, or the top 1% on average possesses some the worst money management skills but are the loudest about lecturing poor people about money management. Most rich people are born into wealth and have never had to seriously mange their money. They are worse than your average joe, let alone your average poor person. In the rare cases where rich people have become poor or even middle income, they often times end up on the streets often on even a somewhat substantial income because they blow their money on something stupid.\n\nIf you were to someone like Warren Buffet, Elon Musk, or Bill Gates a strict $75k USD a year (not even poor, just middle income) they would most likely be homeless in less than a year.

        "author": "IHNJHHJJUU",
        "selftext": "Even more so that the decision of whether or not to charge a minor as an adult often rests solely on the severity of the crime without considering the person themselves and their associated mental conditions and other factors like domestic abuse. This is particularly relevant to the recent apalachee shooting, in which, shortly after the crime had taken place an officer told the public that this minor would be charged as an adult, presumably the officer knew next to nothing about the perpetrator, and certainly would not have been able to make the skilled psychological assessment to determine to what extent they could distinguish right and wrong and their maturity level, the officer made this assumption based on the severity of the crime. This minor will be tried as an adult simply because they killed 4 people? Why? There is nothing inherent about the crime that indicates that the perpetrator must always understand the significance of the act and is the mindframe of an adult, just because someone murders someone doesn't mean they think it through, it doesn't mean they are a danger to society, it doesnt mean that they are a bad person. I'll clarify that I do think this was the case with the apalachee shooting, the kid had premeditation and was obsessed with school shootings, this doesn't change anything though because the decision to charge the shooter as an adult was not made based on this, but based on the fact that he killed 4 people, he would not have been charged as an adult most likely if he had committed a series of robberies, he probably would not even if he was involved in rival gang violence that lead to the death of another individual. It seems this decision was only made based on some primal bloodthisrty need for revenge, it is victim centric when it is a trial for the shooter and whether or not they should be kept in prison for the rest of their lives, the severity of the crime doesn't matter, what matters is whether or not the child can be determined to be a genuine danger to society.\n\nThis is also present with the case of Carly gregg, it doesn't seem very logical to sentence a 14 year old who clearly could not intuitively understand the severity of the crime and was diagnosed as very mentally ill to life without parole, not only morally think about how cruel that is, that this person made one impulsive mistake and now will be forced into a prison for the rest of their life, never to experience anything ever again, and yet we sill care about the safety of prisons and prisoners rights, but also think about what this actually accomplishes. What does this do really, you have now removed a potentially productive member of society from society for the rest of their lives, you will spend money on them, it seems they could be rehabilitated, which would cost more and would require less effort, and all of the problems would be solved. What baseline does this set? The current system we have in place with the insanity defense says that she would not qualify for this, which I would agree with, but it's as if the mental illness is completely irrelevant if it wasn't crippling severe? It was obviously a mitigating factor and this polarization is what leads to a child getting sentenced to life without parole. It doesn't seem very useful to consider cases like this from a strictly objective \"they murdered someone, they knew what they were doing, they deserve to never have rights again,\" the justice system will lay out a set of arbitrary ethical rules, and then the actual argument over what the person gets sentenced to is over whether or not they meet those criteria, not whether or not they deserve to be in prison, whether or not those rules were ethical in the first place is never considered. It irks me when murder trials focus so much on premeditation as if thats a better indicator of whether or not someone is guilty of the crime over their actual degree of intention to cause harm and what that looked like. A child of extreme abuse could kill their parents and plan that for a year and it wouldn't matter in most peoples eyes compared to if they had done it after just being severely beaten as an impulsive act.\n\nIt seems a more efficient system would be one that bases the judgement on each individual case, it shouldn't be either adult court or child court, I would agree that a 16 year old serial killers probably needs to be in prison for the rest of their life, but it doesn't seem like it matters if they are in adult or child court or not. Child court carries the assumption that there is something about a child that isn't defined by solely their age, that a child can't think something through, that a child will always have a certain level of experience, intelligence, and maturity. What really bothers me is just the hypocrisy, we don't give children any significant rights, they are still the slave of their parents until they turn 18 but we also establish that they must have the \"adult\" conception of the reason and logic and experience to murder someone, it seems ridiculous.",

        "selftext": " Let's get one thing out of the way, first. I do not like the designs of Concord. The game makes some very odd choices with its characters, whether it be odd pallets, a general appearance that doesn't match their role or occupation, or my personal biggest peeve, just painting humans a different color and calling them an alien. The only design I even sorta liked was One-Off, and that's just because I like how bulky and \"friend-shaped\" his design is.\n\nBut, honestly, I would take them over the endles swarm of cry-woker redesigns made by people who only hate the designs because \"they're woke.\" People go on and on about what a massive sin it is that the cast tries to be diverse and \"oh my god, the characters aren't sexy!\" As a result, a lot of redesigns over-sexualize the characters and come off as soulless and sterile. The go-to for far too many Daw redesigns is to make him skinny, as if him simply being fat (and possibly trans) is the problem with his design. Most of the female character redesigns just focus on making them \"sexy\" and giving them big breasts. Hell, even with the alien designs, artists usually don't even fix my main issue with the red guy, purple guy or mushroom lady, as most redesigns I've seen of those three STILL look like humans in make-up!\n\nAnd, just so we are clear: I'm asexual/aromantic.  I am not persuaded by big breasts or sexy faces. I tend to look at people for who they are and not what they look like. So maybe that's why I don't like seeing these totally-not-sexist cry-wokers who totally don't see women as objects throwing a tantrum over characters \"not being sexy,\" but frankly, cry-wokers infuriate me in general. They label anything that doesn't pander exclusively to them as \"woke,\" they instantly boycott games just for giving you the option to make your character fat or trans or whatever, and it's hilarious how one of their biggest champions in gaming is a furry-slaughtering simulator despite claiming how furry it is to slaughter furries as a bearded pale guy with a tail, and funny how furries seems to be the only group NEITHER wokes or cry-wokers seem to give a shit about.\n\nDespite this, my frustrations are far greater with anti-wokes/cry-wokers than the woke crowd.",

Besides that, the community is split between bedrock and java players, with usually a lot of hate between these groups. Making a definitive edition would upset a large part of the community for a while, but I believe it would be better for the game's health in the long run\n\nIf Mojang goes through with making bedrock the only version, they would have to really, REALLY work on it before they implement that change. They'd have to fix all of the performance, quirks, overall slowness and bugs that plague this version. \n\nThe ideal scenario would be making a new game from scratch, because then they'd have more room to decide which mechanics they'd take from each version, like deciding between having java's or bedrock's combat, redstone, etc. But I doubt they'd take this route because it would break compatibility with most marketplace items\n\nBesides that, let java still be playable in all of its versions up until the last release as they have with its beta and alpha versions\n\nAlso, this is coming from a java player. Bedrock right now is not that good, it feels clunky and slow, but if Mojang fixed these issues I'd be glad to switch versions \n\nEdit: java can't be the definitive version since it's only available on PC and performance is terrible, and Microsoft signed a contract saying that they can't monetize java, so all of the marketplace items would become unavailable",

        "author": "Nousernameideas45",
        "selftext": "TW for disordered eating, self harm.\n\nBefore I get started, I want to address a few things off the bat. I am not, under any circumstances, trying to downplay any other form of self harm or any other psychiatric disorder, I am simply trying to argue that eating disorders are not nearly treated with the seriousness they deserve. Additionally, this post will mainly be about anorexia nervosa, as that is what I have personal experience with, but most of what I will say applies to all forms of eating disorders. I will also try to source all claims I make.\n\nFirstly, I wanted to address probably the most crucial point in my mind, anorexia nervosa has the [highest ](https://www.eatingdisorderhope.com/information/anorexia/anorexia-death-rate#:~:text=The%20anorexia%20death%20rate%20is,and%20often%20long-term%20treatment)[mortality ](https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-020-2433-8#:~:text=Anorexia%20nervosa%20(AN)%20is%20a,rate%20of%20all%20psychiatric%20diseases)[rate ](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/eating-disorders/what-are-eating-disorders#:~:text=Anorexia%20Nervosa,-Anorexia%20nervosa%20is&text=Anorexia%20has%20the%20highest%20mortality,be%20a%20very%20serious%20condition)of any psychiatric disorder, with a mortality rate of about 3% (which is incredibly high, not even accounting for the underlying factors that contribute to eating disorders), and affecting around [4% of women and 0.3% of men in their lifetimes, with bulima nervosa affecting another 3% and 1% respectively](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8500372/). This alone should raise huge alarm bells, yet research is[ grossly underfuned.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5608830/) \n\nNow anecdotally, as someone who has struggle with both eating disorder and other various forms of self harm in my teenage years, only one of them lingered and followed me into adulthood, even after recovery. I've accepted that my relationship with food and my body will never be the same, and I have a litany of health issues either directly or indirectly stemming from starving myself for the better part of a decade. In comparison, other forms of self harm, while still unhealthy, didn't leave anywhere close to the lasting impact on me. (I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO SAY AGAIN, I AM NOT TRYING TO DOWNPLAY ANYTHING, ONLY TALKING ABOUT PERSONAL EXPERIENCES). This is also backed up but research, with anorexia nervosa linked to [bone thinning, low blood pressure, heart damage, and brain damage/organ failure as a worst case scenario](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/eating-disorders). \n\nMost people believe eating disorders as an active choice, almost akin to a diet, that is made by the sufferer, but in my and many people I know's experiences, it is much more similar to an addiction. People nowadays are a lot more educated on addiction and how it's a psychological phenomenon that's not as simple as \"just stop drinking/smoking/etc.\" not only can going cold turkey be harmful but thorough the process of recovery it's extremely easy to relapse/undo all the work you've put in.\n\nHowever, people don't realize that the same logic applies to people who suffer from eating disorders, my theory is that a lot of people have experience with dieting which is often an active effort for them to \"keep\" their diets and think that people that struggle with anorexia are the same way and \"forcing\" themselves to not eat and it can be ended at any time by just eating regularly again. \n\nWhile a lot of it is definitely forcing yourself to starve/run/etc. it's just as much of a compulsion as an alcoholic or a gambler. And when you eventually start the road to recovery, depending on how severe it was, [your own body actively works against you](https://www.gaudianiclinic.com/gaudiani-clinic-blog/2021/1/28/hypermetabolism-in-eating-disorder-recovery). You've starved it for so long that it now doesn't trust you to consistently power it so when you start eating properly it'll feel awful at first. It's a super slow process of gradually introducing more and more food and higher and higher quality food. You go from a small meal every other day to every day, you increase the size of that one meal at first until you can go to two small meals, and so it goes.   \n  \nUnless, of course, you end up relapsing which is super easy to do because starving is ultimately free and invisible. You don't need to go buy booze or cigarettes, it's not apparent to people you interact with on a daily basis, and you can even justify it to yourself by saying you're saving money.\n\nIt's absolutely heinous that one of the largest invisible killers in our lives today is dismissed as nothing more than the vanity of teenage girls. Not just that, but it's one of the only psychiatrics disorders that is encouraged by society at large. Most victims are vulnerable or traumatized kids, told that starving would make them feel better or that convinced themselves that restricted eating is the only way they can have power over themselves.  [Over 30% of victims have experienced sexual assault](https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/sites/default/files/ResourceHandouts/TraumaandEatingDisorders.pdf), and even more only form it as a result of other trauma.  \n  \nHow is it possible that, in this age of mental health awareness, we turn such a blind eye to such a big issue? Why do we still push and parrot outdated narratives (mostly unchallenged) about such a harmful disorder? Does a diseases victims mostly being teenage girls render it undeserving of care? Or does it only matter when it makes them less appealing by damaging their skin.\n\nI don't have answers to these questions, I just hope to raise more awareness about the horror and gravity of this disorder.",

        "selftext": "I keep seeing videos where people rant or discuss the issues with YouTube Kids, focusing on how child predators roam these platforms, and how much inappropriate content is on the platform, and everyone keeps saying they need to be a \"safe place for kids.\"\n\n... But why should they be for kids at all? Do people forget that there was a time when YouTube Kids didn\u2019t even exist? Most young children during the early years of YouTube weren\u2019t on the internet except for flash games or MMOs that had majorly strict communication tools (if any at all), and because the internet wasn\u2019t heavily geared toward them, these problems weren\u2019t as widespread. The rise of these issues only came about when kids started entering spaces that were never meant for them in the first place.\n\nI don\u2019t think the answer is banning NSFW or provocative content across the internet. That\u2019s not realistic, and honestly, it's troubling that we\u2019ve entered an era where restricting artwork and media literacy is being normalized and/or dismissed in some areas because of purity culture. Even if restrictions were enforced, the algorithms and monitoring systems will always be flawed or broken, leaving gaps where problems persist.\n\n\nThe real solution is shifting the target demographic. I don\u2019t think the minimum age should even be 13+. It should be 18+. Sure, there can still be Cartoon Network, Nickelodeon, and other family-friendly channels for people of all ages (because adults enjoy that too), but platforms like YouTube, if not most social media, should primarily cater to mature audiences. If kids end up on a site intended for adults, that shouldn\u2019t be the platform\u2019s fault. The focus should be on parenting and setting up proper boundaries, not altering the entire internet to suit the needs of children. \n\nTrying to make the whole internet \u201csafe for kids\u201d is a losing battle. It's not about sanitizing content, but about reinforcing that the internet isn\u2019t designed to be a children\u2019s playground, and the policies should reflect that reality.\n\n\nEdit: Reiterating again, a child watching an R rated film on a cable network isn't the cable network's fault. It isn't the movie's fault either. A child playing an M rated game isn't the video game's fault. If a child enters an adult website, that is not the website's fault.",

        "author": "BlueJayWC",
        "selftext": "And yeah before you say anything, this is unfortunately a 10th dentist opinion. This show is loved by everyone age 6-30, including myself when I was younger\n\nBut nah, this show is bad.\n\nYou know what a story needs? Stuff like, character development, structure, basic narratives. None of that is in Dragon Ball Z. It's just a bunch of training montages, roid rage screaming, hair colour changes, and fight scenes. Sometimes the fight scenes are legitimately good, but most of the time it's just a fucking mess that reuses the same tropes over and over again. Wow, Krillin is punching INSERT\\_VILLAIN\\_HERE and he's not even reacting? He must be suuuuper strong!\n\nLike I said, some of the fights are good, like 17 vs Piccolo. What made that fight so good was that 17 and Piccolo were more or less equally matched and they were throwing hands, but the vast majority of the fights is an overpowered villain beating up the Z team (whatever the fuck they're called) until Goku saves the day, or an overpowered hero (usually also Goku) just effortlessly beating up the bad boy. None of that is interesting, who gives a shit? Why did we need to see Cell fight Gohan for like 3 hours when Cell was hopelessly outmatched? Could have just solved that whole situation in one punch, man. Same thing with Cell and Vegeta, or Vegeta and Frieza, or Buu and Gohan (both for and against). This is just fucking stupid man.\n\n\"Hey, this universe destroying monster killed my entire family...I'm going to smack him around a bit until he powers up and kills me also!\"\n\nFight scenes aside; this \"story\" is anything but. Where's all the character development? Gohan and Vegeta are literally the ONLY characters in the show that have anything that resembles a character arc, and Gohan's arc gets flushed down the toilet. Most of the characters are either static (like Goku), talking MacGuffins (Bulma) or background props (Yamcha, Krillin and Tien).\n\nThe latter group are memed to death because of their uselessness. I didn't finish the original Dragon Ball, but I remember it being a martial arts story where, with enough perservance and hard work, anyone could overcome a challenge. Tien beat Goku at one point, but dragon ball Z comes around, and the only people that actually do any work are the Saiyans (except occasionally Piccolo). Yeah, that's great, if you want to be useful, you have to be an alien monkey man. Casual racism at it's finest, am I right?\n\nDragon Ball Z also sucks because of the dragon balls. It's really hard to get invested into a story where anyone who dies can just come back with no strings attached. That's why 1) the Saiyan saga is the best saga in the show because they didn't introduce Namek yet and 2) History of Trunks is probably the only Z-related material that is an actual good story. Yeah, the side story about a world without dragon balls is the only story that I can wholeheartedly say is good, because the deaths in that world are permanent and thus have consequence. How many times has that bald piece of shit Krillin died? Like 6 or 7 times so far?\n\nThis show is also kinda fucking boring. I know it's a product of it's time, but it's so god damn slow, the dialogue (of which nothing of importance is ever said) takes SOO long. They really should have trimmed the fat. A lot of episodes are just 49% talking shit to provoke a fight, 1% a punch, and 49% shit talking over that punch. Dragon Ball Kai is obviously way better at this than Z, but it still suffers from the other problems above. Why did we need to see 10 minutes of Goku screaming just to go through yet another stupid transformation? Take a lesson from that fascist propaganda Attack on Titan, lightning strike that transformation, and hop right into the action.\n\nPost got a bit longer that I intended. Yeah, fuck Dragon Ball Z, dragon deez balls.",

        "author": "transtown",
        "selftext": "There is a correlation, though. It just so happens that a lot of substances only obtainable through intensive, complex chain chemical reactions possible in recent years have very real deleterious effects. \n\nSure, a given drug might be unnatural and lifesaving. But even it is not without side effects, including side effects that *weren\u2019t known when the drug was still under patent*, and whether the benefits outweigh the risks can be discussed by a doctor and ultimately decided by the patient. \n\nI italicized the key thing\u2026 the problem with so many synthetic substances is not that they\u2019re \u201cunnatural\u201d (technically, they\u2019re no more unnatural than bread or concrete), but that the substances are so new that we don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like for a person to live a full life exposed to them, and even if they\u2019re somewhat old, not enough properly controlled research has been done, and such research might be either (1) unethical or (2) difficult when you can\u2019t find a control group who never is around those substances. And since being the subject of scientific research is voluntary, not many people will put themselves out there for intensive exposure.\n\n\u201cSynthetic compounds are harmful\u201d is definitely a generalization, and the contrapositive is definitely untrue \u2013 \u201cnatural\u201d substances include uranium ore, poison ivy, and snake venom. But \u201csynthetic\u201d almost always means \u201cnovel\u201d, and even if a particular compound (like a flavoring naturally occurring in grapes) is \u201cfound in nature\u201d, the extracted version might be harmful for being too high in concentration!! And while fructose is found in fruit, so is fiber, and your digestive tract absorbs the sugar into your system more slowly. \n\nIt\u2019s important to consider that we can\u2019t really say something is harmless right away, and there are always oversights. Think of vape pens \u2013 the logic is that you\u2019re basically breathing in mostly the same stuff as a fog machine, that any additives are food safe (such as Vitamin E\u2026 hello, popcorn lung!\u2026 guess they never heard the expression \u201cwent down the wrong pipe\u201d), and that nicotine itself is merely addictive, unlike the deadly tar from cigarettes (not quite true, and the vapes got people who wouldn\u2019t have smoked into nicotine). \n\nA whole bunch of \u201cX is basically Y with I\u201d and oversights got us the vape pen. Now they make THC vape pens and \u201cLegal Magic Mushroom\u201d vape pens somehow sold with Mimosa Hostilis AKA DMT\u2026 all started out marketed as \u201charmless fog machine vapor\u201d and \u201celectronic\u201d\u2026. As if some gullible idiot would think an RF modem tricks your brain into thinking there\u2019s nicotine in your blood. \n\nAnother closely related refrain is that \u201cyou can\u2019t say that a substance being similar to another substance means they don\u2019t have similar effects\u201d.\n\nYes, this is often true, and actually adds to my above points, but to suggest one drug being \u201cone atom away\u201d from another is a worthless talking point dismisses the very real concept of structural analogues. \n\nSure, O2 and CO both have one oxygen atom bonded to another atom, whether carbon or another oxygen. Sure, one is needed for life, and one is deadly. But hear me out\u2026 both are really good at bonding to hemoglobin!!!!\n\nThere are many structural analogues of DMT, which is an analogue of 5HT AKA Serotonin. \n\nPTFE AKA Teflon is similar in structure to polyethylene. \n\nRisperidone and Paliperidone are one oxygen atom apart. But both are potent antipsychotics that bond to all the same receptors. \n\nAnd then there\u2019s the illicit designer drug craze\u2026\n\nThe Federal Analogue Act was passed for a reason!!!!",

The show leans on absurdist humor mixed with absolutely asshole characters. They also have some genuinely catchy musical numbers that I find myself humming occasionally.\n\nMy favorite running gag is the random economical lessons the show sprinkles in, like when Robin teaches the titans about Equity or how to avoid paying taxes.\n\nAnother standout joke is in the movie where Robin asks the kids in the audience to ask their parents where babies come from at the last minute.

        "author": "Loose_Badger6583",
        "selftext": "I remember a thread in here a while back about lolicon artwork (e.g. hentai depicting child characters) and how it was pretty much unanimously agreed upon that it was some form of, or encourages, pedophilia and was actively harmful. I\u2019ve heard these arguments about as long as I\u2019ve been on the internet, but there\u2019s another side of things I always see brought up adjacent to this that pretty much always gets the opposite conclusion, but I fail to see how it\u2019s much different.\n\nAgain, for reference, \u201cage play\u201d is a type of sexual roleplay where one partner pretends to be a child. It\u2019s roleplaying child molestation, essentially, and I personally find it morally reprehensible and disgusting. However, whenever I say this, I always hear \u201cit\u2019s not pedophilia, it\u2019s two consenting adults\u201d. And yeah, that\u2019s true. But it\u2019s also sexualizing child sexual abuse. I fail to see how that ISN\u2019T pedophilia.\n\nIf we accept the idea that liking lolicon art counts as pedophilia, because despite no actual children being involved, it still sexualizes a character that is depicted as a child and appeals to the same pedophilic desire. It\u2019s not healthy. Age play basically does the exact same thing, but you replace artwork with someone pretending to be a child. No actual physical abuse is being committed, sure, but it\u2019s still simulating that and playing it out in a similar way that artwork would.\n\nThis blurs the line especially if someone taking part in this is rather young looking. It\u2019s normalizing the desire to abuse children and pedophilia. And it\u2019s sick. I genuinely don\u2019t know why this gets such a pass when lolicon is rightfully condemned.",

Obviously its because winter is coming, but for it to happen and then snow still doesn't fall for a bit is really unnerving. The grass dying out to a pale beige doesn't help either.\n\nIn the brief time between summer and winter, there just seems to be less weather. It creates an eerie stillness, an absence of activity and action, with nothing but a slight breeze. It genuinely evokes a feeling in me of not just the summer ending, but the world. With the stillness, and light breeze, everything feels too quite, and almost desolate and hopeless.\n\nContrast this with the heat and storms of summer, or the vibrant return and light rains of spring, or cold and chaotic snowstorms.

        "author": "Ling_B",
        "selftext": "(Please note that I have autism which is a social disorder).\n\nI\u2019ve been thinking about my taste in movies and genres lately, and I wanted to share something that might resonate with some of you. While I appreciate comedy films and often enjoy them, I\u2019ve come to realize that I really dislike comedy as a primary genre.\n\nIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t find humor in films; I love many comedies, especially when they\u2019re combined with other genres. What I truly value are good characters and compelling stories. A film that prioritizes character development and storytelling tends to resonate with me more than one that solely aims to deliver laughs.\n\nI think this preference comes from wanting to connect with characters on a deeper level. When comedy takes the forefront, sometimes it feels like the plot and character arcs get sidelined for the sake of jokes. I enjoy humor as a tool to enhance a story or to flesh out a character, but I prefer when it\u2019s woven into a narrative rather than being the main focus.\n\nRecently, Rick and Morty: The Anime came out, and I\u2019m seeing a lot of people mainly upset because \"it isn\u2019t funny.\" As a huge fan of the original Rick and Morty, I\u2019ll be honest, I don\u2019t really find the cartoon funny either. In fact, I actually tend to dislike the episodes that prioritize comedy over everything else the most. That, in my opinion, has led to some of the show\u2019s worst episodes (Rise Of The Numboricons as an example). What I do like, however, are its complex characters, innovative sci-fi premises, and deep themes (Tales From The Citadel, Fear No Mort, Bethic Twinstinct, Rest and Ricklaxation). The anime isn\u2019t bad because it isn\u2019t funny\u2014it\u2019s bad because it has a confusing story and weak portrayals of the characters.\n\nOr, generally, I just want the characters to be good. I like shows like SpongeBob SquarePants because the characters are charming. I like Smiling Friends because of it's surrealism, sense of optimism, and how it absorbs its ridiculousness. I like South Park because of its political commentary and characters.\n\nAlso, I can appreciate when a joke is well-thought out and cleverly written, though it doesn't tend to make me laugh.\n\nBefore I made this post, I watched a bunch of Jim Carry and Will Ferrell movies. I honestly didn't like half of them outside of a few such as Cable Guy and Elf. I couldn't sit through Dumb and Dumber or Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby. To me they felt like a live action version of a crappy adult cartoon.\n\nAnyone else feel this way? What are your thoughts on comedy as a genre?",

        "selftext": "Tldr: you clean my lint, and I'll clean yours. You're already going to pull out that vent or check to see if it's clean before you run the dryer. Everyone should just be cleaning the vent before they use it. Boom. Now no one has to clean it after.\n\nThink about this:\n\nCurrently, there are many people who don't clean the dryer lint vent thing after drying clothes. This has led a lot of us to always checking before starting the dryer anyway. \n\nInstead of getting mad at the last person to use it, I think we should be asking ourselves why we clean it after anyway?\n\n*\"it puts the burden on the person after you to clean up the mess that came from your stuff if you don't clean it after\"*\n\nBut how did you know it wasn't cleaned? If you expected it to be clean,  you would never check the lint before starting it. So sure, it adds \"burden,\" but you are opening/pulling out that lint trap anyway! You do it because you are worried about it, adding stress and anxiety into the mix. \n\nBut what if it's always that way!? If it's always going to be dirty before you put in your load,  you know you have to clean it. It takes the worry away.\n\nYou take care of the person's lint before you use it, and the next person will take care of your lint before they use it. No one is pulling double duty on the lint removal. Now the \"burden\" evens out and now everyone is only cleaning the lint trap once. \n\nBy telling people to just clean the vent before you use the dryer, no one is going to have to be worried and needlessly pull out the lint trap thing before use to check if it's clean or not. \n\nI think the best thing,  is to just always clean the lint before use,  not after. Along with making sure people know why we clean the lint trap(so they know to make sure there's no lint on the trap before they use it themselves)\n\nSaves headaches all around.\n\nThis is coming from someone who checks the lint trap before use, and removes my lint after.\n\nSure, if we were all taught and actually did clean the lint after, this wouldn't be an issue. But the fact of the matter is, it is an issue.\n\nBut if we teach people, now, to remove lint before to prevent fires and to make sure your clothes are drying properly, then everyone will only be cleaning the lint once. Before.\n\nThis solves a problem that's current, and doesn't rely on \"well if everybody cleaned it after to begin with...\" because that would require time travel.\n\nPeople are already worried that the last person didn't clean the lint after. \n\nStop cleaning your lint thing after, you're going to check beforehand anyway, so just do it once.\n\n(There very well may be reasons that I'm not thinking of, and maybe for people with sensory issues this might not be the most pleasant, but for the most part,  i think it it would solve the problem, and by keeping our current mindset, its just creating arguments, when a fix is just to stop cleaning it after)",

That is INCREDIBLY valuable because the product that brings that entertainment WOULDN\u2019T exist without them. \n\nThese sport leagues make absurd amounts of money. May I suggest, where should the money go? To the rich owners of the league, or to the players of the league that actually make the product itself?\n\nThese leagues also have unions to make sure the players get paid. I thought unions were a good thing? \n\nI\u2019m all for the players getting paid, some of these sports are incredibly dangerous (like football) and their careers are incredibly short. Given the nfl makes 18 billion dollars of revenue each year, I think the players making the league possible deserve to get paid ridiculous amounts of money.\n\nNow are certain jobs underpaid? Absolutely, but I don\u2019t think that holds any weight to this conversation, that\u2019s a completely separate conversation.

In the US at least, these athletes are getting paid all through INCOME. That means they pay a LOT in taxes, usually 50% or even more. \n\nThe other multi millionaires/billionaires of the world do NOT pay their fair share because they hide their money in asset appreciation and have practically no \u201cincome\u201d.

        "selftext": "*putting an edit up top here because people commenting all seem to be jumping on the abuse thing, the abusability of benadryl is not my primary gripe with it. i'm far more concerned about it being used long term as a sleep aid, which is something it is actively marketed as for some fucking reason despite there being plenty of research that proves why it should NOT be used for that. as for its main use as an antihistamine there are better options available and for emergency allergy situations i think epipens should be otc, but that's kind of it's own post. anyways edit concluded, carry on to the initial post:*\n\ni have many personal gripes with that stupid pink antihistamine to go over in this post, my qualifications for having such gripes including being a nerd about dementia and also having a history of abusing the shit like a fucking dumbass. i should also preface this by saying that benadryl is one of the only antihistamines that works for me, so i am coming at this from the perspective of someone who uses it and is less biased than someone who it doesn't work for\n\nin order to understand why benadryl is such a fucked up medication we first have to understand how it works. benadryl is a first generation antihistamine and acts as an anticholinergic (meaning it interrupts acetylcholine h1 receptor neuron signals, which is how it blocks histamine response) and an antimuscarinic (which blocks specifically muscarinic acetylcholine neuron signals). while these do get the job done relatively effectively, these come with a myriad of side effects that greatly outweigh the benefits. chronic use of benadryl, especially when used for sleep due to it preventing proper rem sleep, has been linked to a higher risk of dementia, especially when taken by people over 60. this is due to it being anticholinergic as while it does block the h1 receptor to stop histamine responses it also just blocks neuron communication in general which is not good for you. it also breaks the blood brain barrier and is moderately neurotoxic which is why it makes people loopy and can be used \"recreationally\" (i put recreationally in quotes because this shit is not a fun party drug or something it honestly kinda fucking sucks, i would know i've struggled with on and off use of it for years because i'm bipolar and am also kind of stupid)\n\nif the neurological effects aren't enough to turn you off another thing it fucks up is your renal system. it is highly dehydrating and again is antimuscarinic which can lead to urinary retention and kidney damage if used excessively. even when not used excessively it can cause prostate issues and pain and just generally kinda fucks with that part of the body. it also increases your heartrate by a not insignificant amount and can cause sudden cardiac arrest if abused (which again is fucking stupid don't abuse benadryl)\n\ngoing back to the abuse of benadryl another reason i believe it shouldn't be an otc medication is because of the ease of access for abuse and the dangerous ramifications of the abuse. some people may just view this as a darwinism thing where if someone is stupid enough to do so they deserve what they have coming but i personally don't for obvious reasons\n\nbenadryl does have its benefits at times i will admit, such as when used to help treat multiple sclerosis and overactive bladders, and also as an antihistamine to give during an allergic reaction. beyon that though it's just an overall shitty medication that really shows its age\n\nyou may be wondering what i propose as an alternative to benadryl and to that i point to second generation and onward antihistamines such as claritin and zyrtec and even just other gen 1 antihistamines that are less aggressive like hydroxyzine\n\ntldr benadryl sucks fuck benadryl\n\nedit: the abusability is not the primary reason i think it should be prescription only, the main reason i think it should be prescription only is that i think only people who other antihistamines just don't work on should be using it due to the side effects that come with it or for people using it to help with things like multiple sclerosis. beyond that, other options are just better\n\nedit 2: i have been informed by people with multiple sclerosis that it is in fact not good for that use either, that was wrong on my part",

But after having a session where I shit you not I did not roll above a natural 7 on a D20 I started using weighted dice and as a DM I tell my players to use a specific weighted dice (or we account for it post roll). 2, 4, 6, and 8 are replaced with a second 12, 14, 16, and 18. It doesn\u2019t break the game but it adds just enough of a buffer to make an unlucky session slightly less miserable and the unlucky moments can be funny rather than just making a player suffer while also not negating stat bonuses that are a natural buffer anyway.\n\nI allow all my players this specific form of weighted dice and a nerfed version of the Luck feat with 1 luck point basekit (I buffed lucky feat to 5 points if they take it). And I don\u2019t believe in crit fails (just an automatic failure)\n\nThey get more freedom to roleplay and tell their story while also making it much more satisfying.

But when 1 game is coming out every 10 years just for a product that people play for the same amount of time as something with a 5 year development cycle, it\u2019s just a waste.\n\nThe hype train gets out of control, expectations get too high, and people are left growing up and moving on before they get another instalment of their favourite game series.\n\nElder scrolls for example. Skyrim took like 2 years of production planning and 3 years of actual development. Make another Skyrim. It doesn\u2019t need to be 5 times the size and 10 times the content. Just make another game and gradually increase the scope over multiple instalments into the franchise.\n\nI\u2019d much rather Elder Scrolls 6 have been a game with a similar scope to Skyrim that came out in like 2017.

If your art can be replicated and replaced by AI then fact is you weren't that visionary of an artist.\n\nAI art makes art more accessible to everyone.

        "author": "ElectronicBoot9466",
        "selftext": "Often times, when drawing battles, comic artists will show characters sustaining these massive flesh wounds and getting other big injuries and show said wounds healing over the next few panels as they continue to fight, and on paper it looks really really cool. And I don't really mind it at all when it happens all the time to a character like Deadpool for whom it makes total sense to me to not really care about defense and just let every enemy attack land. \n\nHowever, the problem for me comes from drawing characters like Wolverine, or Scout, or Sinister, or Wolverine who all have enough sense to know that sustaining injuries isn't ideal, since they can take enough damage to be taken out of the fight for a bit which can (and often has) result in defeat and capture. When these characters get hurt, it's implied it's not because they're letting themselves get hurt, but because the enemy is skilled enough to hurt them. \n\nThis isn't an issue in solo bouts, but when one of these characters is fighting on a team, it just completely breaks the illusion for me to see a villain manage to get these MASSIVE hits on a wolverine but every other member on their team is completely untouched or only has a scratch or two. All it does is remind me of the absolutely impenetrable plot armor that all the characters have, because I know the artist is giving said injuries to a character with healing factor because they know they can do so without them killing the characters. \n\nIt kind of ruins the tension of any fight for me, because it reminds me of the plot armor every character is wearing.

Not only because of how much I miss her (and will always miss her), but also because of the impact it left on our whole family. It's been especially hard on my mother, and as much as we do our best to support and comfort her, there's no changing the fact that she lost her mother, and a part of herself with her.\n\nBut here's the thing. As humans, we understand the cycle of life and death. We know death is inevitable, and that the impact we leave on the world and the memories of us that our loved ones carry on will endure after we pass away. One of the last things my grandmother said, even as speaking became extremely difficult for her, was \"Oh, that's neat!\" She said that in response to seeing a picture of me and my husband getting married, which happened shortly before. In other words, life goes on. That creates a path toward healing, even if it takes years and the grief never really goes away entirely.\n\nOn the other hand, pets have no idea what death is. They don't even know they're dying. All they know is that they're in pain. If you're there with them when they die, they probably take comfort in your presence because they think you're there to protect and help them. When in reality, you're there to kill them. Even at the end, they think you'll keep them safe.\n\nFor some reason, that messes me up more. Just typing that out caused me to start tearing up, and that didn't happen for the first two paragraphs.

        "selftext": "Telling people to \"go to therapy\" isn't the \"gotchya\" that you think it is. I'm not saying therapy has no value, because it does. Therapy can definitely be helpful, but stop acting like sending people to therapy is the end-all-be-all.\n\nFirstly, we need to address the very real problem that therapy is not affordable to most people.  Secondly, we need to address the fact that many therapists are simply not very good at their jobs (I've been to 8+, multiple ethical violations took place, will discuss later).\n\n(Please note, this post is NOT addressing people who have ever been psychotic, delusional, or who have OCD. I can't speak to that at all).\n\n**Here are incidents where therapy can 'fix' a problem:**\n\n-You have mild anxiety or stress\n\n-You're not very self-aware of your emotions or thoughts/just aren't very smart in general, and need a therapist to decode them for you (this is an extremely large category of people, and honestly most adult men)\n\n-A traumatic event that was scary, but was a blimp in your otherwise good life\n\n-You want to chat with someone about your problems and have someone help you navigate them\n\n**Here are things therapy is less helpful for:**\n\n-Your life genuinely sucking for external reasons (severe poverty, severe illness that would make anyone depressed, etc)\n\n-Life-long trauma/personality disorders (there is still a very poor professional understanding of most, if not all personality disorders. The fact is that many psychologists truly think you can't \"fix\" Cluster B disorders, ultimately admitting to their lack of utility to relatively common issues, or those who actively demonize Cluster B folks is unfortunate)\n\n-Most complex feelings that go beyond simply being 'aware' of what your problems are, and realizing they are not rational, but being unable to actually change them nonetheless\n\n--\n\nAs for psychologists/psychiatrists, no, I'm not saying not to go if you genuinely need medication, medication is nice. I'm simply complaining because : \n\n-It is hard to get an ADHD diagnosis if I'm not a low IQ 8 year old boy that's jumping around an office. Truly, psychiatrists do not know how to identify it otherwise.\n\n-A lot of psychologists have poor understanding of trauma, and a relatively weak understanding of PTSD, or CPTSD to the extent that they miss large warning signs\n\n-Perform IQ tests so badly that their mistakes are regularly 20+ points\n\n**Stupid shit I've experienced:** \n\n- Therapist saying my parents loved me. This was our first time meeting. I never said anything about my parents\n\n- Told office I was abused when trying to schedule me\n\n- Said I liked rough sex because I felt I \"deserved it\" -> Surprise, not really true at all \n\n-Therapist reminded me of my \"privilege\" then called me hot\n\n- Asking therapist if I had personality disorder and them responding, \"Do you want one?\"\n\n- Talking about something traumatic, them responding with \"That happened to another patient for mine. It was hard for them\" \n\n- Told me not to get an abortion. I Wasn't pregnant \n\n-My IQ tests ranged by 25 points ",

        "author": "Galvantic_",
        "selftext": "Now, to get this out of way - it is VERY clear that he has had an incredibly good first season and then the summer after with the Olympics. He is practically a lock in for the Defensive Player of the next NBA season, and he's already easily a top 40 player in the NBA. However, I have some flaws that I project may make his career worse than people expect, and i'm really worried about that.\n\nFirst, let's just talk about physical longevity. Guys as tall as him do NOT last long in the NBA. Look at Joel Embiid. He is significantly shorter than Wembanyama by about 3-4 inches, and he is constantly getting injured and hurt. He has only had two seasons where he has been MVP-eligible, and the other ones he has always been injured too much to play a full season. And, consider the fact that Wemby is still 4 INCHES TALLER. He will need to focus extremely on conditioning, and even then, that's a lot of time spent away from the court on conditioning instead of actual training.\n\nSecondly, he does NOT have a good core around him. This is to be expected from a team that literally just got number one draft pick, but he just doesn't have the people around him that might be necessary to be better in the playoffs. They got Chris Paul, which is a super valuable addition (another unpopular opinion, I actually have him in my top 10 players oat list), but let's be honest - he is old at this point. Now, for most #1 picks, this is okay. But, this man is being projected as LEBRON + JORDAN! His team can't just be doing \"ok\". Lebron was carrying his team HEAVY instantly upon entering the league, and Wemby isn't doing that. This will seriously hamper his future GOAT case, and I can easily see guys like Kareem or Shaq being above him still.\n\nFinally, we have to talk about the Olympics choke. Not only did they lose to team USA in a game that was theirs to win (they kept it EXTREMELY competitive the whole game before losing to what was essentially 3 aging superstars), they also lost a game to Germany. Their star player is DENIS SCHRODER. I just... that is not something a future GOAT does by any stretch of the imagination, especially w/ already the DPOY on the team as well.\n\nSo, overall, remember this is NOT about his skillset or talent. He is obviously intensely talented, and I can't wait to see where his future goes. DPOY at 20 is insane. But I don't think he will be in the GOAT CONVERSATION or even top 10, much less the actual GOAT. But that's unpopular.",

Buzzed, drunk, and wasted are different degrees of severity. I feel that saying buzzed driving is drunk driving actually downplays the dangers of drunk driving since it equates driving fully drunk to driving with a light buzz.",

        "title": "You're not always a \"hypocrite\" for being mature enough to talk against your issues ",
        "author": "TheStonedWiz",
        "selftext": "I often see this sentiment where if you actively do something (or have done something) and talk against it, you're just a hypocrite. That's not even logical and it's complete bullshit to anyone that actually thinks about it. \n\nExample; someone that smokes tobacco telling people that smoking tobacco is negative and stupid. You'll always get offended people complaining about \"well YOU do it!!\" but it's like no shit, that's literally why I'm talking about it and that's literally why I have the qualifications and justification to talk about it. It isn't even logical to call someone a hypocrite. Every addicted smoker on earth should know it's stupid and they just push people away from the addiction. Any logical smoker that's mature enough to admit their problems would do just that. If you have literal experience and knowledge of something, it makes logical sense to share that knowledge. Who is someone going to listen to more; someone that's actually been through it and living through it, or someone that just read a few online articles? Come on now. \n\nBut the thing is, people are so half assed on what they call hypocrite. They usually only call someone a hypocrite when it's about something they personally feel some kind of way about, regardless if what they're saying is the truth. Like to bring me back to the original example; just because I/someone smokes tobacco, that literally doesn't change anything that's being stated or the truth behind it. Being offended that someone that's there/been there is talking negatively about it is just ignorant. With experience comes wisdom, with wisdom comes life lessons. That's just the way it goes. \n\nAlmost everyone laughs, claps and cheers for inmates in prison that do the \"beyond scared straight\" programs; showing the youth their mistakes and where it could bring them. Talking against the things they used to do doesn't make them a hypocrite, it makes them someone that's sharing firsthand, secondhand and third hand knowledge. Just because someone doesn't like what's being stated doesn't magically make them a hypocrite. It means they're teaching and influencing people to not make those same decisions. \n\nThere's a line though. Is it \"wrong\" for someone to make another out to be the most fucked up person in existence when they currently do the same things as them? In a way, yeah, that would be hypocrisy, but either way that doesn't magically change or remove the fact that their actions could use adjusting. People all too often get sensitive about what someone says, call them a hypocrite and then just completely shut out anything logical that's being stated. Ignoring logic because you don't like who's saying it (or how it's being said) is just immature ignorance. You don't need to like who's saying it, you don't need to like how it's being said, but actively ignoring the truth behind the statements is arrogance. And if it's coming from someone that's literally living that life? Just quit getting offended and be open/mature enough to hear them out. \n\nMoral of the post; quit calling everyone that has experience with something a hypocrite when they talk against it. That's what happens when people want to teach and push others to do better than them. Are you not gonna listen to a drug addict telling you not to get into the drugs they're doing because it'll ruin your life, just because you arrogantly don't want to listen? \n\nNothing everything is being a hypocrite lol. \n\nHope everyone is doing good. Hope everyone in your lives is healthy and alive. Enjoy the rest of your Monday. ",

Eventually, the licenses run out and have to be renewed, or they might decide renewing it again isn\u2019t worth it. In that case, the song might be removed from the game or the game might be delisted from digital storefronts. \n\nI think delisting is the better choice. Removing the song butchers the experience for those who bought it digitally. The song might be replaced with copyright free stock music or something. [Look how many songs have been removed from GTA4.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA/comments/8f48c1/full_list_of_all_removed_songs_from_grand_theft/) if it were delisted, those songs could still be there. \n\nWith delisting, the experience is left intact. You can still download your digital purchase, unmolested. Even if you didn\u2019t get it while it was available digitally, you can get a physical copy if you\u2019re motivated enough. Even if that isn\u2019t an option, there are other means. \n\nCase in point, spec ops the line was delisted earlier this year rather than remove the songs.

It should be considered a crowning achievement of modern computing that such a service is possible to sustainably operate at all, let quite alone with the vast majority of watchers (!) having free-to-air access.\n\nI literally cannot place myself in the mindset of someone who complains as much about the commercials as most people on this website do, because it would seem to require just a really fundamental ignorance of the fact that most things cost money and most business ventures require some kind of incentive.",

Honestly there\u2019s more similarities than differences.\n\nThe phrase should be two wildly different things like \u201capples and airports\u201d or \u201cpacking peanuts and cross stitch patterns\u201d.\n\nEdit: people are saying now that it\u2019s used to discuss things that are mostly different but have superficial similarities. I propose a new idiom: \u201chorses and house cats\u201d. Both are animals that walk on four legs, but they are WILDLY different in abilities, uses, etc. beyond their quadrupedal stance and hair, they are completely different.\n\nI maintain that this is NOT true for apples and oranges.\n\nEdit 2: maybe I need to reexplain. If the systems are so different but also kinda similar, use two objects that are actually different but kinda similar, not nearly the same with tiny differences.\n\nYou can tell how similar objects are by comparing them to objects that are even more dissimilar. Apples and airports for example, you struggle to find any similarities without stretching.\n\nThis is why I prefer the term \u201chousecats and horses\u201d. There are superficial similarities (animals, hair, tails, quadruped) that aren\u2019t a stretch (a stretch would be made of matter, exists, is on earth) but aren\u2019t even close to the same thing (one is used way differently than the other with almost no overlap).\n\nI\u2019ve been saying that in the comments but people still think I\u2019m saying \u201cuse apples and airports\u201d only.

Mealtime is me time. I'll clean every surface and tool I use so it's suitable for everyone to use after me, but what I eat is my business.\n\nIf the food is edible to me, then the smell is absolutely bearable to anyone in range of it.

        "selftext": "I will preface this with saying that I am a lifelong fan and I wish him only the best. That being said, I think Ronaldo making YT channel is terrible idea in the long term because huge part of what was making Ronaldo so highly desired, stanned and admirable was his relatively shadow persona and scarcity of available info about his personal life. \n\nA big part of what has made him such a captivating figure is the aura of mystery surrounding his life. His fans have long been intrigued by the occasional glimpses of his training, his incredible work ethic, and his performances on the field, which created a larger-than-life persona. \n\nBut, by sharing almost daily videos about his life and opinions, he risks diluting that mystique, because the more he reveals, the less special he becomes. The charm of a celebrity often lies in their elusiveness; when fans feel they know too much about a star\u2019s personal life, it can lead to a sense of overexposure and even disillusionment.\n\nAlso, the shift towards vlog-style content feels forced even right now at the very beginnings of his channel. It kinda comes off as an attempt to cater to trends rather than a genuine expression of who he is. This perceived insincerity could alienate long-time fans who appreciated his dedication to football over the spectacle of social media. \n\nAgain, I only wish him the absolute best, I just feel like after the initial shock effects of his subscriber count fades away, he will end up with a dull and even forcing channel, with his new uploads feeling like chores rather than genuine amusement to his audience. Not to be delusional enough to think that he will ever lose insane relevance and popularity but it will be less and less about \"the greatest football player of all time\", he will be gradually detached from his immense success in football. Maybe, it's about me, as a fan, still wishing him to be shining on the field like in his best days, but yeah, that's it. ",

They're only doing it for the money just like everyone else, but if people don't buy then they won't profit, so in reality the people you should be \"mad\" at are the people who are constantly buying/falling for their products/schemes everytime, because clearly A LOT of people are buying despite the outrage online. And I'm not defending the product at all, obviously it's not better than eating real food, but people let a shit ton of companies get away with selling people sugar products everyday for years on end and they are thriving. So what's really the problem? The people selling shit or the people constantly buying it?\n\nIn all honesty I think none of this really matters, and people should be more focused on themselves and their own life instead of what's going on social media, I can't understand getting mad at people you'll never know when you have your own problems to deal with.",

From my observation, the latter tends to overshadow the former on occasion.\n\nThis is especially true for egregious felonies and crimes committed under the knowing eyes of a larger authority group or figure. That indicates a deep level of corruption and/or general crappiness that needs to be weeded out, and goes beyond just the fact that some asshole was a hateful projecting felon.\n\nFor example, a politician can claim every member of the opposing party is in the pockets of private donors, then get busted for corruption and fraud. Yes, it's scummy that they tried to discredit scores of politicians, especially if all or most of them weren't financially corrupt, but patching up the loopholes that led to the fraud and corruption, if possible, deserves just as much attention.\n\nOf course, politicians aren't nearly as comparable to the example I used in my last post, but I hope I made my point clearer hear (if not, tell me how I could word it better, because I really don't know how). Now, could I just have tunnel vision, and people are filled with righteous anger at around the same amount to both parts of these issues?

        "author": "MR_DIG",
        "selftext": "I know and have known many people in relationships where they don't want to have sex with their partner. They will say that they love them and want to be in a relationship because of several reasons. But being sexually attracted to them isn't one of those reasons. They actively choose to be in a relationship where their partner really wants to have sex with them but they don't reciprocate that same feeling.\n\nI also know and have known people in relationships where they have, not had but actively repeatedly have \"bad or unfulfilling sex\" with their partner. I think that this should be a deal breaker. I don't care if you have x, y, z reasons for dating someone, if you are having sex where only one person wants it, GO FIND A DIFFERENT PARTNER.\n\nIf you don't value sex, you can find someone that also doesn't value it and live happily. But most of the time, I see relationships where 1 or both parties value sex quite a lot. Yet it is somehow unfulfilling and still happening.\n\nIf people only dated people they want to have sex with (or don't want to have sex with if the other person feels the same way) then I think people would be way happier.\n\nThe only reason that this is here is that when I hear someone talk about not wanting to have sex with their partner, others will respond with saying \"me neither\" or \"mine too\". I mean how messed up is that? How is it that so many people see sex this way? As something that doesn't really matter, even though we live in a monogamous society where that person SHOULD be the person you want to have sex with. Because we generally discourage having sex with other people.\n\nEdit: Before anyone else mentions this. There are a lot of people in long term relationships where people change and stop wanting sex, and there's nothing that can be done about that. But I'm talking more from seeing long term relationships where they have sex but one side \"isn't being fulfilled in the bedroom\". That should never happen, you shouldn't get married if you still aren't being fulfilled during sex. Also I'm not advocating for polygamy either.  \nAlso there is a big difference between \"dating someone you don't want to have sex with\" and \"not wanting sex at all from anyone\".\nEdit: People who are ace should date people that don't like sex or other ace people\n\nEdit: a lot of this post is referring specifically to people who will have sex with their partner and then complain that they aren't getting what they want out of that sex. Not necessarily the quantity of sex being had.\n\nEdit: can confirm that I don't know how to write apparently because 95% of comments don't understand what I'm aiming for here. I tried. I think that my take is generally disagreed with but whatever people are getting from my post is either that it's super obvious and everyone agrees, or I'm trying to impose my will on others and everyone disagrees. I promise there is a level of nuance that I'm trying to hit.",

        "selftext": "Preface: I love hbomberguy, I enjoy his videos. He completely deserves the lauded reputation he has. On top of this the plagiarism video is very good and most of my issues come with the fallout of the video. \n\nIn my view I don\u2019t think Hbomb made enough of a distinction between plagiarism and copyright infringement in his video and conflated things that are much closer to copyright infringement (namely internet historian\u2019s actions) than the traditional idea of \u2018plagiarism\u2019. \n\nNow I do definitely think that hbomb does actually talk about plagiarism (ive seen some people try to argue he didnt but I think that is false) but the fact he conflated similar yet different things has had some bad consequences. \n\nMainly I think his video effectively \u2018buzzwordified\u2019 plagiarism. Its now become an accusation to fling at people with the likes of narcissist, sociopath or gaslighter. On top of this people tend to call things that are very much not plagiarism and are more likely to be copyright infringement plagiarism.\n\nI think this is a bad thing because its softened ideas of plagiarism, which is like a proper academic issue, in the consciousness of people. On top of this its made trying to discuss the fact that plagiarism is super common throughout the entire internet more difficult because the idea of \u2018plagiarising\u2019 has become linked with the specific ideas from Hbomb\u2019s video. Because you can very easily argue that the huge number of youtube channels (for example) who discuss historical ideas without citing their sources are effectively plagiarising. \n\nTL;DR: Hbomb\u2019s video was very good but imo its made plagiarism a far too common accusation in situations where it doesnt apply while at the same time getting in the way of actual discussion around the prevalence of plagiarism online.",

Epic just feels anachronistically American.\n\nReason I'm making this post is because a line really got to me - Athena is trying to sell Hera on the idea of Odysseus, and says \"never once has he cheated on his wife\" as a dig towards Zeus and his infamous endless kids. However, he DID. Three times, if I remember all of them, and it's actually convinced people that he hasn't because the musical is determined to make him as heroic as possible to the western listener. Overall, I just cannot stand it - it's grating, poorly written (with the source material in mind) and I don't get why people like it.",

That shows that you\u2019re not as important to them as you think they are to you and since the feeling isn\u2019t mutual it calls for grounds to get rid of them since they don\u2019t care about you so why should you care about them.

        "selftext": "Now I want to make it clear I see the reason for these people's agenda is obviously for the better, or at least what they think is the ethical thing to do. But at the same time, their level of thought is so misguided to the point of being just downright ignorant and foolish. 2 years ago I can say for certain 99.99% of these people likely didn't know a fucking ass thing about Israeli-Palestine at all. Heck most don't even know what the Intifidas are and probably heard Hamas for the first time ever on Oct 7th.\n\nFrom what I see their whole argument nowadays is merely based from these four lines of narratives, all of which are extremely one-sided shallow and filled with huge holes of ignorance since they cant even be bothered to do basic fucking research on the shit they regurgitate from some tiktok video they watched. Or better yet, just asking a simple word, \"why?\"\n\n***\"Oct 7th?? Nonono, it started 75 years ago! 1948 Nakba!\"***\n\n* This is a very, if not, the most common argument going around pro-Palestinian people whenever people bring up Oct 7th on why Israel has the casus belli to go to war with Hamas (and let's not get into how some of them were even denying Hamas committed 7th Oct...). Go back in history and the actual historical fact is the Palestinians brought this unto themselves. THEY started the 1948 war, not the Israelis. In 1947, the UN offered a partition plan, even giving Palestinians more fertile land, and yet the Palestinians refused while Israel willingly accepted for a peace compromise. The Arabs proceeded to start the first bloodshed and rest is history...\n\n***\"Israelis came from Europe and should go back there!\"***\n\n* This is one of the most dumbest, ignorant thoughts I keep seeing spread around and a nice piece to bring blame to Europe for the conflict. In truth Israel's demographics is far more complex than that but all these people can't even bother to do with a simple google search. Around half of Israelis actually came from the Middle East, NOT Europe, which is why you will hardly find any blonde hair blue eyed person in Israel. A lot of them also came unwillingly, driven by the antisemitism where they lived and esp after 1948.\n\n***\"Israel is occupying the West Bank!\"***\n\n* There's a two-fold argument to this one since it is indeed easy to condemn Israel's pro-settlement actions in recent years. At the same time, it pisses me off how no one seems to even question WHY Israel came to occupy the West Bank in the first place. This all came about from the 1967 Six Day War (which again, the Arabs started first with Egypt blockading the Suez Canal). The land Israel took control after that was as a security measure after they realized how vulnerable they were if the Arabs could have land so close to letting them bomb and invade the shit out of Tel Aviv if they ever so wanted to again. Is this some paranoia on the Israelis' part today? Sure, but at the same time they weren't the ones to start this shit in the first place. The Palestinians are like that little kid bully in school who hits the bigger student then runs to hide behind the teacher when the bigger student gets angry and wants to retaliate. It's the same shit that happens over and over again, and the general public, with 0.1% knowledge of history, just buys up the same victim sob story as usual.\n\n***\"The Palestinians and Jews were living in peace before the zionists came!\"***\n\n* This is another utter load of horse shit, I dont know where the fucking idea even came from (prob some stupid tiktok video for sure). The Palestinians were already at odds with the Jews from the very start and already started the beginning riots like the Jaffah riots against the Jews since 1920.   Before the mass migration of Jews, sure I guess they were \"living in peace\" when there were hardly any Jews before that in the first wave of migration from Eastern Europe.\n\nI've gotten into arguments with so many pro-Palestinian people here and all over social media before and 100% of the time, I always come at the top eventually since every fucking time, these people will regurgigate either of the same 4 points I've addressed above which can all so easily be refuted by historical hard facts. It's almost tiring at this point since I know I can't educate the whole world so yeah I guess we can only watch the chaos unfold. I also find it funny how a lot of them are the usual anti-west tards who somehow also support Russia invading Ukraine. Literally all their same arguments can be turned against them as hypocrites for the Ukraine War\n\n\nAnyway last but not least I want to clarify I'm not some pro-Israel zealot here. I just hate all the misinfo and ignorance spreading around social media driving the stupid mass protests we see today. If you ask me, this is really a never-ending war driven by stubborn extremism (jihadist Palestinians' fault) and far-right paranoia (far right Israeli's fault). ",

        "selftext": "Most of the ones I've seen and met are what you would expect. Think of a character from Diary of a wimpy kid or some high school drama movie where the underdog loser nerd main group takes on the antagonist big bad chad jocks and frat bros. It's better to be honest than lie about it and be a wolf in sheeps clothing. I will be transparent I am not a feminist nor do I care about them or their stupid movements. Should women be allowed to vote, work, own property? Absolutely! That's it they have their rights what more do they want? Don't know nor do I care I only care about my Latino community and what's going on with us. But I digress, male feminists are just absolute creeps. I promise most of them aren't even feminist it is just a last ditch attempt of getting laid \"I treated you good. Where sex? Why can't you see and appreciate what a nice guy I am?\" Putting down and throwing fellow males under the bus just to look good to women. Allowing women to treat them like a doormat they can never step up and take charge they just allow life to happen to them, I've met guys who call activities like going to the gym, playing sports, violent movies and games etc. \"toxic masculinity\" so what do they do for fun? Probably watch girl movies and cry. I have many more examples of white knights and simps being so embarrassing and low that this could be the length of a book, but the last straw that made me come to this conclusion not a personal experience but there was a video of a self proclaimed male feminist who went on an explosive rant because the girl he was white knighting and simping for a year for didn't like him she would constantly ignore him and disrespect him he was delusional and she eventually got a new man he proceeded to use slurs that rhyme with punt, switch, glut, smore etc. well what a mask off moment this doesn't look good bro.\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention here but in a comment I did. In high school there was a kid I knew involved in liberal feminist extracurriculars he was accused of groping there were witnesses too. Another example of how creepy and desperate they are.",

Hostility to any post - every post will inherently get downvoted therefore decreasing the value of subreddit, by the extension entire site\n2. Users will force their disagreement upon everyone - agreeing with a stranger on reddit is not tolerable, if you agree with someone, it means you 'lost the argument' and you lose your prestige\n3. Fake news and propagating lies - users will hide, change or straight up invent narratives for any reason they find convenient, tainting legitamicy of the so called 'front page of the internet'\n4. Pseudoscience reigns - indulging in scientific discussions will lead to factual fallacies and abhorrent individual behaviour doing disservice to humankind\n5. Emotional and psychological support subreddits are doing more harm than good - people will open their hearts and emotions to strangers on reddit leaving it exposed for most disgusting users to exploit them for their personal amusement\n6. Fandom subreddits operate with dogmatic and hivemind/occult mentality - expressing love/hate on specific topics in entertainment industry such as games, movies, anime, books etc. will result in ridicule of a member and repulsion to the communty by the member\n7. Promoting toxic and dangerous ideologies - promoting despicable acts and thoughts targeted towards individuals/groups with bigoted and zealous intent wherever/whenever an opportunity arises\n8. Rejecting personal opinions and free speech - getting censored or banned from expressing your personal concerns/thoughts/opinions on certain matters\n9. Moderator power mongering - Misuse of moderator tools and responsibilities to gain personal satsfaction or to promote propaganda\n10. Propaganda itself - was it political, religious, scientific, ethic or something else, if you are not in the line with the status quo, you will get suspended, censored, harassed, dehumanized and left concerned for the state of this site as a whole, only if you care enough\n\nI used reddit for the past 15 years or so and seeing deteriorate to the state it is in right now doesn't concern me  much, but I'm concerned for its oblivious users who will use it carefree not knowing the dangers it poses. And that's all without mentioning outrageous monetization of the site, sharing groosome footage and sexual materials, exploiting vulnerable groups like children, minorities, people with disabilities, races etc.\n\nMy younger sibling started using reddit few months ago and I was very against it, and she shared some personal emotional baggage on one of the advice subreddits and she was met with hostility and harassment from fellow 'advice givers'. So I decided to write this list to give this site a spotlight and treatment it deserves.",

I also keep seeing people say \u201cwhat do you think the Vice President does? Quickly,\u201d when anyone critiques Kamala Harris. We also all saw the coordinated revisionist history in which we were gaslit into believing that Kamala Harris was not appointed to oversee the U.S.-Mexico border. It was so bad that publication(s) had to backtrack their own statements and apologize for insisting she was never in charge of the border because those same publications had previously reported that she was.\n\nShe\u2019s the Vice President of the United States of America for crying out loud. To claim she had no power or influence to do anything is just a ridiculous thing to say, especially considering that we _know_ Joe hasn\u2019t been at the wheel for God knows how long.\n\nOther than the fact that it\u2019s a complete lie, it\u2019s funny to me because it\u2019s a clear admission that the past four years were a failure. If the Biden-Harris administration were a huge success, she would be campaigning on it and her supporters would be highlighting how amazing Biden-Harris was as a reason to vote for her. However, they\u2019re not doing that because they _know_ it was a major failure and they need to separate her from it as much as possible to have a chance at rebranding her and fooling the American people into believing she\u2019s someone completely different.\n\nI could elaborate further and pull direct quotes from Joe Biden that he said on The View and during the latest press conference, in which he explicitly said that him and Kamala Harris worked together on everything and that they had the same amount of power, but the people parroting this line would just move the goalpost or tell me it doesn\u2019t matter for some reason because they\u2019re already committed to their position. So I\u2019ll hold my breath.\n\nAccuse me of being a Trump fanatic or whatever as much as you want, but I\u2019m voting Libertarian this year, which is what I\u2019ve done in every election I\u2019ve been eligible to vote, if you must know. The point of this post is that Democrats are majorly telling on themselves by insisting Kamala Harris had nothing to do with the Biden-Harris administration.\n\nThis is not the talking point leftists seem to think it is. It\u2019s an admission of failure. **Even if you buy that she was not involved at all, which the sitting President has explicitly disputed numerous times now, the fact that people are so desperate to claim she wasn\u2019t involved at all tells you everything you need to know. She would have no problem being associated with the administration if it were a major success.**\n\nFor some reason I feel like leftists will change their tune on this take rather quickly if Trump/Vance win in 2024 and Vance runs for President in 2028.

        "selftext": "Full stop, if they became just a hardware company, I wouldn't mind.  I think the Switch is a decent portable gaming device, and to be fair most first-party Nintendo games would be decent pack-in titles.\n\n.... But little more than that.\n\nIt's almost embarrassing for Nintendo's games to be spoken of in the same conversation as the rest of gaming.  This company... its like the people at Nintendo live in a bubble where they intentionally ignore the rest of the gaming landscape.\n\nLike I've seen people point out: any other company doing the \"let's repeat a boss, but its slightly harder\" thing would get villified by nearly everyone.  But for some reason Nintendo doing it is okay?\n\nIn general whenever I play a first-party Nintendo title, they always give me this paradoxical feeling of being both high-effort but also lazy at the same time.  Take Breath of the Wild.   Clearly it could not have been easy to make, but then at the same time you wander the world and fight the same six enemies in literally every region.  Even the original Zelda on the NES did things like \"in the mountain area you're more likely to see those centaur things, near the beach you're more likely to see octoroks and those spinny things.\"  This is before getting into the shrines or the uselessness of quests yada yada we've heard the complaints.  And apparently TOTK improved f--k all.\n\nIn the Switch generation I noticed additional things.  Their games tend to have extremely questionable UIs and control choices, made worse by a lack of customization.  In an age where customization is *a standard feature*.\n\nAnd then of course there's things like how Shigeru Miyamoto will actually make developers remove story stuff, even from games intended to be RPGs, because he apparently still thinks its the 1980s and games are supposed to be *just* gameplay.\n\nFinally, of course, I had to mention this:  instead of actually *competing* with someone who comes along and shows them how it should be done, they decide to just use the legal system as a blunt instrument and destroy their competition.  Rather than actually make better games and *not* release them in buggy unfinished states, they prefer to try and create a world where you have no choice but to buy their slop.\n\nI hope Nintendo goes out of business, I really do.  It would serve them right.\n\n**EDIT:**  Soo.. a lot of the responses make me wonder if Nintendo fans have actually played non-Nintendo games, because so much I'm seeing is highly dubious or in some cases just factually incorrect (someone literally claimed Nintendo invented open-world games, just for example, while another claimed that Pokemon is the only RPG with party customization... just, what?)\n\n**ADDENDUM:**  Another recurring argument is \"Nintendo actually makes games, not movies-with-gameplay or realistic FPS.\"  Yeah, *only* Nintendo makes games that have gameplay and little/optional stories.  That Hollow Knight thing?  Doesn't exist.  Celeste?   Doesn't exist.  Monster Boy and the Cursed Kingdom?  Puyo Puyo Tetris?  Sonic Mania?  Doom?  Don't exist.  F-ck me its like Nintendo fans themselves have literally never heard of games that aren't Nintendo.\n\n(This is putting aside that I find the \"games shouldn't have stories\" argument itself kinda narrow-minded--what, did you guys hate the Rosalina moments of Mario Galaxy?--but fact is Nintendo is far from alone in making story-lite games that aren't realistic FPS... which incidentally is a genre that's been on the decline for years, showing just how little you guys have been paying attention).",

One could say \u201cwhat about freedom\u201d, and while that is a good argument, the drinking age at 21 as opposed to 18 only restricts people who are 18-20, a small window of adulthood. People this age are often able to drink anyway but no one cares, and it\u2019s because those people are dependent on others which prevents the floodgates from opening. Alcohol causes a ton of damage to society from car crashes to bar fights to domestic violence to broken families to cancer and other health problems. Meanwhile the military protects this nation from threats. The draft hasn\u2019t been used in decades and would only be used in emergencies (extreme circumstances). So it\u2019s not logical to think drinking age should automatically be adult age, there are good reasons for it being 21.  \n\n",

I interpreted that as even though someone looks big they could be leading a healthy lifestyle. If someone is eating right, exercising, and losing weight they are healthy. This also segways into my half point.\n\n1/2- Despite claiming we care about health we as a society are quicker and feel more comfortable to criticize a bigger person\u2019s health decisions then we are a skinnier person. \n\nI\u2019ve witnessed this personally as someone who used to weigh 200lbs I would watch my  petite alcoholic sister down easily 2500 calories a day with no exercise and no one would criticize her but god forbid I have a medium fry from Mikey d\u2019s. We glorify overeating and accept it as long as the person eating is skinny. If a skinnier woman in a video eats a meal that is clearly 1000+ cals  we get a whole lot of \u201cI love a woman that eats like this\u201d (indicating they want a woman who is consistently eating very large meals) but let it be a bigger woman do you genuinely think she\u2019ll get the same reception?\n\n2- Clothing is a valid complaint.\n\nBigger people need clothes and there is nothing wrong or entitled about asking for clothes that fit ESPECIALLY when a store advertises themselves as inclusive. Like when you lose wight you don\u2019t become a size 2 in a day lol.\n\n3- Body positivity movements are within their rights to not highlight a group of people who are not receptive to BP movements. Yes I\u2019m talking about men\u2026 the main people who have an issue with BP movements are men. They Have made it  abundantly clear that a lot of them do not approve of BP movements but then complain when they\u2019re given exactly what they asked for. It\u2019s like an atheist who constantly talks down on religion getting upset that those religions do not pay attention to them. Also before people bring up insults everyone gets insulted on their body it is extremely acceptable to make fun of people for their bodies!",

        "author": "StatisticianGreat514",
        "selftext": "This has been going on for decades now. Whenever a Black, Hispanic, or any other Minority votes Republican, their community comes after them and accuses them of selling out their community down the line. They always refer to them as Uncle Toms. The main reason they use that term is because they denigrate their race in order to elevate their status among others and quite frankly, there is a lot of truth to that. Look at Candace Owens, Brandon Tatum, Jason Whitlock, David Clarke, Jesse Lee Peterson, Jon Miller, Herschel Walker, Mark Robinson, Kathy Barnette, Vince Ellison, etc. Most of the time they trash their race with negative stereotypes including those who don't fit them. They claim that they're trying to help improve the Black community but they offer little-to-no productive solutions. As a matter of fact, the first person listed here actually admitted to trashing Blacks. As a result of such terms being used, many Conservatives, most of whom are White have accused them of racism.\n\nBut you know what strikes me as strange is that these same Conservatives who accuse these people of racism for saying Uncle Tom use similar language themselves to describe Liberal White people. Some of the terms they use are Cuck and Beta. Ever since Obama was elected President, they believe that White people who voted for him did so out of White Guilt because they don't want to be seen as racist in voting a Black man for President. They also highlight the Woke Social Justice Warriors who denigrate their race in order to elevate their status among others just like some Black Conservatives do. They also target people like Robin D'Angelo who wrote the book \"White Fragility\" for being the textbook definition of White Guilt. This year, they called the \"White Dudes for Harris\" campaign such terms because they see it as humiliating men, particularly White Men. And last but not least, they call any Conservative/Republican politician (again, most of whom are White) they see as compromising their values on certain topics like race, sexuality, religion, etc. such terms, too.\n\nSo basically, I find it hypocritical that Conservatives, especially White Conservatives get pissed when minorities call people of their kind for voting Republican as Uncle Toms and Sellouts for putting down their own race in order to get approval from others, when they literally do the same thing without fail. Why is one racist while the other isn't? If anything, this is a great example of White Privilege. As a matter of fact, let me ask you a question. What do you find more racist? Someone putting down their own race in order to gain approval from others or calling someone an Uncle Tom for doing that? I say it's the former. Putting down your own race in order to get approval from others is much more racist than calling someone an Uncle Tom/Sellout because it shows that you have no sense of self-esteem, dignity, and respect. Malcolm X and Marcus Garvey said Uncle Tom themselves and it's been applied for the exact same reason that it is today. Are they racist by definition? Be honest.\n\nIf anyone is offended, too bad. It's not racist to call out someone engaging in Self-Deprecation. It's politically incorrect. Remember, the word \"Racist\" has lost its meaning according to you guys.",

        "selftext": "Dear White People on this Subreddit,\n\nI've recognized that many of you have been complaining about a lot of Anti-White Rhetoric that's being present in society nowadays whether it be online, TV, etc. and you've been addressing such things on this subreddit along with many other subreddits that are in-line with your thinking. I can obviously assume from reading them that you are all Conservatives because that's quite frankly, the only form of racism that you fight against and because this sub obviously upvotes Conservative opinions.\n\nYou've always complained about how White people are the butt joke in society, that there's discrimination against White Males, systemic racism against Whites, along with general Anti-White sentiment from the Left. But most of all, you've criticized the perpetrators behind such acts as being Self-Hating White Leftists who have White Guilt. In the end, you've always pondered what you should do to stand against this.\n\nWell, as a lurker on this sub, I have a suggestion on what you should do to combat Anti-White Rhetoric and White Guilt being perpetrated from the White Leftists. I want you to start calling them Uncle Tom and Sellouts. Yes, I'm being absolutely serious when I'm saying this. I'm not joking at all. These terms are something that a lot of People of Color call people of their kind who vote Conservative/Republican. The main reason why they use such terms is because they see them as tearing down themselves and their race in order to elevate and validate their status among others, obviously White people.\n\nI mean, isn't that the same thing that White Leftists are doing to you? They're tearing down themselves as well as their race in order to elevate and validate their status among others, obviously People of Color. But apparently, it's racist if the latter does it because you accuse them of being incapable of thinking for themselves. In reality, what they're doing is common sense because putting down your race in order to gain approval from others is stupid. It doesn't matter if you're White, Black, etc. Doing so indicates you have no sense of self-esteem, dignity, and respect. I mean look at Malcolm X and Marcus Garvey. They've used Uncle Tom before in the same context that it's being use today. Are they racist by definition? Be honest with me.\n\nSo here's my suggestion that I want to give you on this sub, Righty Whities. Start calling them Uncle Toms and Sellouts. In fact, you have many variations of those that managed to make their way into Right-Wing Lingo such as Cuck and Beta. Oh, and as a matter of fact, you've used those terms before to describe such people. Look at the \"White Dudes for Harris\" campaign. That's a classic and literal example of such. And while you're at it, apologize to all the People of Color, including me that you've falsely accused of being racists for using such terms because they had a point. It's much more racist to put down your own race in order to get approval than it is calling someone an Uncle Tom for doing that.\n\nNow go on. Say them. I dare you.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAn Ethnic, Racial, and Religious Minority Liberal.",

The reason he kept giving that weird look to the camera, because, he (by his own admission) was \"nervous as hell\".\n\nEveryone can take a quick look through my post/comment history and can tell I'm not a fan of J.D Vance, maybe it's just my personal bias against him, but, I'm still standing by the opinion of he didn't do that well, especially after having seven weeks to prepare.",

        "title": "Covid Restrictions did not work and there is a lack of research because scientist do not want to be wrong",
        "author": "Burnlt_4",
        "selftext": "Quick look at my background. I am a published researcher from a top 10 university. I publish only in A\\* journals. My university had a special focus on methods and data analysis. In fact, one of our faculty members was the leading expert on research methods in the world, another invented many of the analyses used today, and one is considered one of the best data analysts under 40 in the world. I thought to myself today, as I had a couple of hours, \u201cWhy is there so little research on COVID response and terminal outcomes? I am trained in this, there is available data, and I can run quick analyses and get an idea for myself.\u201d There is some (very few) studies out there but they all state they will not make a call on the actual results, or measure weird outcomes that don't matter (like only measuring hospital improvements of a state during Covid as a way to measure effectiveness of covid response and ignore things like death from Covid!), or honestly are just smoke screens with catchy titles that then measure something entirely different haha.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that it doesn\u2019t help anyone if I publish SAS or R data here, as most won\u2019t understand it. So, I will keep it to a simple two-category approach. But first, I think we can all agree on the following summary of the \u201ctwo sides\u201d during COVID-19 (AI was used to search the internet and create this list to avoid misrepresenting a \u201cside\u201d):\n\n**Pro-Vaccine/Lockdown**:\n\n* Belief in the necessity of widespread vaccination to control the virus.\n* Support for government-mandated vaccinations to protect public health.\n* Endorsement of lockdowns and social distancing to slow virus transmission.\n* Trust in scientific and medical experts to guide policy.\n* View that individual freedoms should sometimes be restricted for the greater good.\n\n**Pro-Freedom/Live as You Wish**:\n\n* Skepticism of government control over daily life, including lockdowns and masks.\n* Belief that people should assess and manage their own risks related to COVID-19.\n* Concern for the economic, social, and mental health consequences of lockdowns.\n* Distrust or questioning of the extent of the threat posed by the virus and the response.\n\nA few things that are very important right from the start: We have to look specifically at the U.S. response without comparing it to other countries. It makes much more sense to look within our country than to look at other countries. Here in the U.S., we are a large landmass with quite a big population, but that population is mostly very spread out. As you go state to state, differences are few at the core. Therefore, looking at individual state responses is the most accurate way to control our sample as much as possible. What works in China, Europe, or Africa\u2014we really do not have a clear understanding of how it would work here. Therefore, all data will focus on between states, as they are more relevant. Additionally, I withheld the District of Columbia, Hawaii, and Alaska from the results as they are in more unique situations. HOWEVER, I want to point out that after running the analysis including and excluding them, the results were the same.\n\nLooking at (1) COVID restrictions, (2) COVID deaths, and (3) economic performance, I examined many factors\u2014far more than Reddit needs to see\u2014but for a thorough analysis, I looked at things such as various lockdowns and COVID restriction rankings. There is actually an index of 11 practices that states implemented, and you can see the various degrees to which they were enacted. Additionally, for economic success, we look at unemployment rates, new business openings/closures, GDP, median income fluctuations, buying power index, etc. But again, when presenting results briefly here, we will keep it as two sides of a coin to keep it simple. All data was taken from the CDC, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, World Economic Forum, *The Wall Street Journal*, and *The Lancet*.\n\nOut of the 48 available states in this analysis, the 24 with the fewest COVID restrictions, in order, were: Iowa, South Dakota, South Carolina, Florida, Oklahoma, Idaho, Montana, Missouri, Utah, Tennessee, Arkansas, Wyoming, North Dakota, Nebraska, Mississippi, Wisconsin, Alabama, Texas, Arizona, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, and New Hampshire.\n\nThe 24 most restrictive were: Louisiana, West Virginia, Ohio, Maryland, Nevada, Kentucky, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Oregon, Michigan, North Carolina, Minnesota, Colorado, New Jersey, New Mexico, Rhode Island, Maine, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Delaware, Washington, California, Virginia, and Vermont.\n\nWe will keep them separated into the two categories of 24 most and 24 least COVID restrictions. Looking at deaths per capita, we would need to control for things such as population density centers, but regardless of controlling for the necessary variables, what we see is that when ranking by death per capita, the states flip almost **exactly even** with restrictions. This means data shows deaths and restrictions were almost perfectly split, with 12 of the 24 states with the fewest restrictions also falling into the least deaths category, and 12 of the 24 states with the fewest restrictions also falling into the most deaths category, and vice versa. Based on individual states, it appears that lockdowns and deaths were literally a coin flip.\n\nHowever, when looking at economic performance, 17 of the 24 top-performing states economically during the pandemic were in the least COVID restrictions category. States with high restrictions suffered the most economically.\n\nMy results ultimately showed that state-by-state COVID lockdowns had little effect on deaths but a massive effect on the economy.\n\nEdit: Too much for me to keep up on, a lot of people like to try and argue the validity or methods of the analysis, the problem is as I said multiple times I didn't put it here because that literally would take 10+ pages to do accurately with another 5-10 pages of tables. I fully respect everyone's opinion, this is what I found and if you disagree I encourage you to do it on your own and then you can either see I am right or justify your own position. Either way it is the internet so if you disagree you can move on and it will not impact either of us negatively. Cheers mates.",

        "author": "Otherwise-Bench-2643",
        "selftext": "There\u2019s a common belief floating around that only the \"top 5% of men\" get to date all the women, leaving the remaining 95% struggling to find anyone. This myth makes a lot of guys feel like they don\u2019t stand a chance, especially in today\u2019s social scene. But here\u2019s the thing:\u00a0**the math doesn\u2019t support this claim at all.**\n\nIf we look at this idea through the lens of math, probability, statistics, and even graph theory, we start to see that this notion of dating being monopolized by a small elite group is not only oversimplified, but it\u2019s also mathematically wrong. Let\u2019s break it down step by step.\n\n* **The Initial Claim: 5% of Men Date All the Women**\n\nLet\u2019s assume the population we're talking about consists of 100 men and 100 women, with a claim that the \u201ctop 5%\u201d (5 men) are dating all 100 women. At first glance, this makes it seem like 95 men are left out. But even before applying any advanced mathematics, this claim is clearly flawed.\n\n* **Why? Because:**\n\n1. *Time is a finite resource*: No matter how \"elite\" these 5 men are, they can only date so many women in a given period. Each man is constrained by time, energy, and interest. Even if they attempt to juggle multiple relationships, there\u2019s only so much attention and emotional bandwidth they can distribute.\n2. *Compatibility is selective*: The notion that these 5 men could form meaningful relationships with all 100 women is unrealistic because relationships rely on personal compatibility. Statistically speaking, not every woman would even want to date the same 5 men. So how does the math break down here?\n\n* **Basic Probability: Relationship Pairing Isn\u2019t Random**\n\nLet\u2019s break this down using probability theory. If we assume all 100 men and 100 women are randomly trying to find a partner, then we\u2019re talking about a scenario where the likelihood of a match forming between any two individuals is equal. Mathematically, each person has a 1/100 probability of being selected by any other person in the pool. The idea that 5 men could monopolize the entire pool becomes highly improbable in this case.\n\n* **Group Theory and Compatibility: Matching Isn\u2019t Universal**\n\nIn mathematics, group theory helps explain how elements (in this case, people) interact within a set of rules. When applied to dating, this means not every person is equally likely to date every other person due to factors like personality, interests, and values.\n\nLet\u2019s say we assign compatibility values (on a scale of 1-10) to each potential pairing between men and women. If we look at this through the lens of group theory, not all pairings will score highly on compatibility, meaning the 95% of men aren't out of the running just because 5 men are perceived as more desirable.\n\nIn reality, the \"top\" 5% of men may only be compatible with a subset of women. So, the probability that a woman will find one of these top-tier men as her best match is \\*\\*a conditional probability\\*\\*\u2014it depends on her preferences. This brings down the odds of the top men dating everyone, because:\n\n*Some women will not find these top 5% men compatible.*\n\n*Women will naturally seek partners in the larger group (the remaining 95%) that align with their own preferences.*\n\n* **Graph Theory: A Network of Connections**\n\nLet\u2019s bring in graph theory to better understand how relationships form in a social context.\n\n* Nodes: Each person (man or woman) is a node.\n* Edges: The connections between nodes represent potential relationships.\n\nIn the graph, let\u2019s say the top 5% of men are highly connected\u2014meaning they have more edges (connections with women) compared to the rest. But even in the most connected graph, the number of edges per node is limited. You cannot have 5 nodes (men) connected to all 100 other nodes (women) because this would require an unrealistic level of engagement on the part of those men.\n\nIn real life, social circles and communities naturally form subgraphs, where people within certain groups (based on location, interests, etc.) are more likely to connect with each other than with people outside their group. Therefore, the 95 other men still have plenty of opportunities to form connections within different subgroups of the population, increasing the chances that everyone forms at least one connection.\n\n* **Statistics: Normal Distribution of Relationships**\n\nLet\u2019s talk about the distribution of relationships using statistics. If we plot attractiveness, status, or desirability on a graph, we typically see a normal distribution curve (bell curve). Most people are clustered around the average in terms of attractiveness or desirability, and only a small percentage fall into the \"elite\" or \"bottom\" categories. Even if the top 5% (5 men) get more attention at first, most relationships form between people who are within a close range of each other on this bell curve. Studies have shown that people tend to date within their own range of attractiveness or socioeconomic status. Therefore, the claim that the top 5% are monopolizing the entire dating pool ignores the reality that people tend to pair with those who are close to them on this curve, which naturally spreads out the pairings across the entire population.\n\n* **Probability of Relationship Formation: The Role of Time**\n\nLet\u2019s now consider the probability of successful relationship formation over time. Suppose the top 5% of men are initially dating multiple women. However, due to time constraints, the probability of maintaining these multiple relationships diminishes. Let\u2019s say the probability of forming a long-term relationship is ( P(L), and each man can only form at most two stable long-term relationships before running out of time.\n\nGiven that:\n\nP(L) \u221d1/ n\n\nWhere n is the number of partners a person tries to juggle. As n increases, the probability of any individual relationship succeeding drops. Therefore, after the top 5% of men have settled into relationships, the rest of the pool becomes available again for the remaining 95 men. The dating process is dynamic, and over time, the chances for every man to find a partner increase as the pool redistributes. This is why the myth that 5 men monopolize all the women is mathematically flawed: the system naturally balances itself out.\n\n* **Survivorship Bias: The Flawed Perception of the \"Winners\"**\n\nA major cognitive bias at play in this myth is\u00a0**survivorship bias**. This is the tendency to focus on people who succeed and ignore those who don\u2019t, leading to distorted conclusions.\n\nIn dating, this works like so:\n\n* We see the \"top 5%\" of men who seem to get attention\u2014whether it\u2019s flashy success on social media or through personal anecdotes.\n* However, we\u00a0**ignore the vast majority**\u00a0of the dating pool (both men and women) who are going through more typical, everyday experiences in relationships.\n\nJust because we hear more about a few highly successful people (or see them constantly on dating platforms or social media), we assume that\u2019s the entire story. But the truth is, the rest of the population\u2014like the other 95%\u2014is also forming relationships, albeit in ways that aren\u2019t as sensational or visible.\n\nIn fact,\u00a0**statistics show that most people date and marry within their social group and attractiveness range**\u00a0(the \"normal distribution\"). This means the dating pool is much more balanced than we think\u2014it\u2019s just that success stories are disproportionately visible.\n\n* **Confirmation Bias: Seeing What We Want to See**\n\nAnother key bias is\u00a0**confirmation bias**\u2014the tendency to search for or interpret information in a way that confirms one\u2019s preexisting beliefs.\n\nFor example:\n\n* If you believe that only the top 5% of men (or women) are dating successfully, you\u2019re more likely to focus on evidence that supports this, like a story of a charismatic or wealthy person who is dating multiple people.\n* You\u2019ll then\u00a0**ignore the evidence**\u00a0of people in the remaining 95% forming stable, happy relationships.\n\nMathematically, this selective observation is akin to looking at\u00a0**an incomplete dataset**\u00a0and drawing conclusions. In statistics, you can\u2019t make valid generalizations without considering the entire population. By focusing only on extreme cases (the top 5% in this scenario), you distort the broader reality of relationship formation.\n\n* **The Appeal to Extremes: A Logical Fallacy**\n\nThe claim that\u00a0*\"the top 5% of men get all the women\"*\u00a0is also an example of the\u00a0**appeal to extremes fallacy**. This is where you take a small, extreme scenario and apply it universally.\n\nLet\u2019s break this down with some basic math:\n\n* In any group of 100 men and 100 women, assuming the extreme scenario where 5 men monopolize all relationships implies that\u00a0**each of these 5 men would need to form 20 relationships**, which is simply impractical.\n* Even if we add dating apps or social media into the equation, where the top 5% of men might initially get more attention,\u00a0**they don\u2019t have the time, energy, or compatibility**\u00a0to maintain long-term relationships with everyone they connect with. The average person can only manage 1-2 serious relationships at any given time.\n\nBy taking this extreme scenario and pretending it applies to all situations, we ignore the more nuanced, everyday experiences of most people.\n\n* **Base Rate Fallacy: Ignoring the General Population**\n\nThe\u00a0**base rate fallacy**\u00a0is when we ignore general statistical probabilities and focus too much on specific examples. In the dating world, this could mean focusing too heavily on the top 5% and ignoring the relationship patterns of the other 95% of people.\n\nHere\u2019s where the base rate fallacy misleads us:\n\n* If you focus only on the \"elite\" group of men or women who are dating multiple people or getting a lot of attention, you might conclude that the dating market is monopolized.\n* However, when you look at the\u00a0**base rate**\u2014which is the statistical distribution of relationships across the population\u2014you realize that\u00a0**most people end up dating someone of similar attractiveness, values, and personality**, not the outliers.\n\nStatistically speaking, the majority of relationships form within the \u201cmiddle 90%\u201d of the population, as shown by numerous studies on marriage and long-term partnerships. This means that focusing on the extreme 5% group ignores the\u00a0**overwhelming majority**\u00a0of real-life relationships.\n\n# \n\n* **Scarcity Mindset: Fallacy of Limited Supply**\n\nThe top 5% myth taps into a\u00a0**scarcity mindset**, a cognitive bias that makes us believe there is a\u00a0**limited supply**\u00a0of potential partners and that once someone takes a partner, it reduces the pool for everyone else. This leads to the\u00a0**zero-sum fallacy**, where people think that if someone else is successful in dating, it decreases their own chances.\n\nIn reality, dating doesn\u2019t operate like a limited resource:\n\n* The dating pool is dynamic: People enter and exit relationships, meaning the supply of potential partners is constantly changing.\n* Most people date within their\u00a0**social circles**\u00a0and\u00a0**compatibility range**, meaning the presence of a few highly successful individuals doesn\u2019t significantly impact your chances.\n\nMathematically, this is an example of\u00a0**dynamic systems**\u2014where the conditions are constantly shifting, and no one group can maintain dominance over the whole pool. Over time, the dating market balances itself out as people pair off, break up, and move on, ensuring opportunities are always available.\n\n* **Conclusion: Unpacking the Top 5% Myth with Math, Logic, and Bias Awareness**\n\nThe idea that only the top 5% of men or women monopolize the dating pool is a myth driven by cognitive biases, logical fallacies, and a misunderstanding of how relationships really work. Through survivorship bias and confirmation bias, we focus too much on extreme cases of dating success and ignore the broader, more balanced reality. The appeal to extremes fallacy leads us to believe that a small elite can dominate the dating market, but mathematically, this simply doesn\u2019t hold up.\n\nUsing concepts from probability theory, statistics, graph theory, and group theory, we can see that the dating pool is far more dynamic and complex. People form relationships based on compatibility, not just looks, wealth, or status. Most relationships happen within the middle of the bell curve, where the majority of people are\u2014not in the extremes. This is reinforced by base rate fallacies, which make us ignore the fact that most relationships are far more evenly distributed than we might think.\n\nMoreover, the idea that dating is a zero-sum game\u2014that if someone else finds success, your chances diminish\u2014is a fallacy driven by a scarcity mindset. The reality is that the dating pool is constantly changing, with people entering and exiting relationships, making it a dynamic system that continuously redistributes opportunities.\n\nIn the end, the math shows us that the odds are much more in your favor than the myth suggests. The dating world is far from being monopolized by a small elite; instead, it's a fluid, balanced system where most people, regardless of their status, have a fair shot at finding someone who suits them. Biases and fallacies distort our perception, but the reality is much more hopeful than the myth would have us believe. So, the game is still very much on\u2014and the numbers are working for you, not against you.",

        "selftext": "I feel like I've made a topic like this before, so this time my tack is gonna be to do \"capsule reviews\" of various games to explain what they did wrong.\n\nTHERE WILL BE SPOILERS.\n\nSo to start:\n\n**Five Nights at Freddy's** -- To be honest I actually do kinda have a soft spot for this series.  I will say the first three games are legitimately good, and Security Breach's Ruin DLC is probably worth playing (Security Breach itself looks broken-but-fun).\n\nFNAF's Major Sin is it popularized the \"Theory Bait\" concept, where instead of telling you anything, you're meant to figure out the facts from random details (often obtuse ones).  I'm not against this idea in principle, but games like FNAF use it almost as a crutch--I low-key suspect the creators do it just so they don't get caught out in a plot hole, and then all these other people realized \"hey, I can do that too!\"\n\n**White Day: A Labyrinth Named School** -- Okay, this one actually works for most of it, apparently on a lot of playthrus its possible to not really know what's going on.\n\nThe problem really only comes when you get the one playthru that reveals everything, and the villainness goes on a *literal supervillain monologue* complete with \"mwahahahaha!\" (she literally does that).\n\nFull stop, the minute your horror game has its main villain sounding like the bad guy from VR Troopers, *you have failed*.\n\n**Silent Hill (as a series)** -- While I do like some parts of these games, they admittedly are responsible for the worst trope in horror game history:  the \"the big twist is the protagonist has secret guilt or trauma\" thing.\n\nYou can argue it kinda worked when James Sunderland did it.... I won't agree, but you can argue it.\n\nH.P. Lovecraft once said the best horror stories are like a \"well executed hoax,\" which I take to mean \"you could believe people actually discovered weird sh-- out there.\"  My favorite shows growing up were Sightings and the paranormal episodes of Unsolved Mysteries.  I still want to visit the Gurdon Lights one of these days.\n\nThe Cthulhu Mythos are interesting because you can get caught up and actually think \"somewhere in this world there really are fish-people with their own society.  Somewhere in this world a tentacle-bearded psychic kaiju really is being held in a big rock somewhere.  Maybe there really are dream dimensions where I can see the literal center of the universe.\"\n\nThe Silent Hill twist and games that use it rob you of that.\n\nNot only that but a lot of time, you rarely get to know these characters *outside* of \"I have trauma.\"  Which makes them fall flat.  Imagine Final Fantasy VII but you never learn anything at all about Cloud or Tifa before the point in the game where the truth about their past is revealed.  The reason it *works* there is BECAUSE you spent hours getting to know them and care about them before the truth is sprung on you.  Same deal with stories like Kanon or Clannad.  Without even mentioning the sad truth about Fuko, I can remember her starfish obsession, her cluelessness, her tendency to speak of herself in third person, etc...\n\n*Silent Hill: A Short Message* on the other hand, I don't even remember the player character's *name*.  She's just some teenage girl to me, so I have zero reason to care about her or her stupid trauma.\n\n**Don't copy Silent Hill.  Just don't.**\n\n**Final Thing**\n\nI wasn't sure which game to make the sacrificial lamb here so I'll just say it:\n\nCOME UP WITH MORE INTERESTING MONSTERS.  I am so tired of games where the monster is just \"normal person but with burn marks\" or \"basically Gollum from Lord of the Rings.\"\n\nReally, if anything, horror shows how uncreative humanity has become.\n\nLet me spell it out for you:  [this](https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/9a602b76-9cc4-47e0-b52f-fe7185f1427c/d87hny3-c4520fb4-3fc5-423b-9063-d0165e406b10.jpg/v1/fill/w_851,h_851,q_75,strp/the_dunwich_horror_by_castlemonster_d87hny3-fullview.jpg?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOjdlMGQxODg5ODIyNjQzNzNhNWYwZDQxNWVhMGQyNmUwIiwiaXNzIjoidXJuOmFwcDo3ZTBkMTg4OTgyMjY0MzczYTVmMGQ0MTVlYTBkMjZlMCIsIm9iaiI6W1t7ImhlaWdodCI6Ijw9ODUxIiwicGF0aCI6IlwvZlwvOWE2MDJiNzYtOWNjNC00N2UwLWI1MmYtZmU3MTg1ZjE0MjdjXC9kODdobnkzLWM0NTIwZmI0LTNmYzUtNDIzYi05MDYzLWQwMTY1ZTQwNmIxMC5qcGciLCJ3aWR0aCI6Ijw9ODUxIn1dXSwiYXVkIjpbInVybjpzZXJ2aWNlOmltYWdlLm9wZXJhdGlvbnMiXX0.X4szn6HRL-vzJtEU7HGwXZI_qBznslGKczBEZ-2_JsQ) is a monster.

        "selftext": "It is unfortunate that I have to clarify that I consider myself progressive, because that just goes to show that the overuse of that term has become mean and abusive by otherwise normal people who become psychopaths when they go online.\n\nTo also unnesessarily clarify things, I DO NOT identify with the official hate filled online community that considers themselves incels. They have their own problems, but tbc i think they are worthy of happiness like anybody is. Reddit users lost sight of the idea that many people deserve forgiveness for having harmful beliefs, including official incels. Reddit users, even many atheist ones are influenced by modern religion since they believe some people are inherantly evil and others are good, in a dualistic way. I think that approach is wrong.\n\nThat said, the term \"incel\" BY DEFINITION implies involuntarily celibate, i.e. someone who cannot help but be lonely, which, in some bizarre way is twisted by redditors to imply that such people are inherently evil because they cannot help themselves or some bullshit. That sounds like a neo conservative value to me, to place blame on people who cannot help themselves. Many of you are considered progressive, and probably believe in universal healthcare or even ubi, but people who are lonely are guilty for being lonely and deserve all the online hate possible? Give me a break.\n\nAnd even if they are the type of \"incel\" that IS misogynistic, just remember there is a good possibility that as a progressive, you want palestine to be free and you probably dont blame hamas for attacking jews. That said, according to your hypocritical belief system, incels who want to hurt women cannot be sympathized with are evil, but people in a terrorist organization who happen to be brown are incapable of being evil, i.e. because their cause is so just they can kill and rape anyone they want.\n\nAlso, Ive had severe social anxiety my whole life. I havent met many people because of how debilitating the anxiety always has been, my personality is very odd, i have autism and bipolar 1 and my life has been hell mostly. To top it off, I harbor zero prejudices towards women. I have been dealt an unlucky hand in life, which is not the just consequence of being an unlikable asshole that you think it is.\n\nThat said, the term \"incel\" does not just refer to hateful misogynists, simply because the term is thrown around so damn loosely, and the people throwing around the term are supposedly always on the right side of justice. If ever someone complains about female characters being forced into star wars, theyre an incel. Any complaint about an unjust loneliness, they are an incel.\n\nIt seems more like a tentpole term to villify anybody who is frustrated by their own loneliness, and the hypocrisy coming from the \"tolerant\" people who use the term is appaling.\n\n",

You don't care about your future generations, and how they will inevitably have to deal with a world scarce and stripped away from resources that their ancestors couldn't be assed to care about? I don't know, man, I could never comfortably do it. Especially if it is non-renewable or more raw materials.\n\nIf it still looks decent or works just fine, just give it to someone else to either keep using it, repurpose it, donate it, or recycle it. Again, this isn\u2019t about hoarding; it\u2019s about recognizing the value in what we have and making sure we\u2019re not contributing to a culture of mindless consumption. It does not have to be every SINGLE thing, but it helps to be more mindful about particularly decent things.",

        "author": "landorose12",
        "selftext": "It also goes the other way in a different sense, which I will get to :3. \n\nA quick background: \nI spent 5 years being a liberal, and as of recently I switched political aisles after listening to the other side with genuine curiosity.\n\n\n\nThe Main Point:\nDuring my time on the left, I never realized how hateful they were towards the right because I really believed that the other side was SO hateful and hated people. It turned into me not wanting to be around my family for quite a while because they were conservatives, and that was purely it. I would call them racist, and bigots to my friends for no discernible reason. I realize now that I was taught through the internet and my feed (Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, friends posts), to hate on the other side. After switching political sides I feel like there tends to be quite a lot of hate from the left that seems to be getting more and more intense as time goes on. I\u2019ve seen lots of videos of people getting assaulted for having differing views on the world, which was a big part of me considering switching sides. Not only have I noticed so much of what seems like hate going towards conservatives, I\u2019ve also noticed it went inward as well. Hate towards white people, straight people, and men especially. Now this isn\u2019t a post to criticize opinions, I understand WHY they have come to the conclusion that white cis gender males suck, I fully disagree but I think it\u2019s great we can disagree there\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with disagreement. Now that I\u2019ve switched parties, I see how hateful the other side is, from old friends and my sister, making huge claims that all republicans are racist bigots and should all leave the country. It\u2019s gotten quite terrifying how divided we\u2019re getting simply because they don\u2019t reach over to the other side and listen, if it keeps up I can totally see a point where a civil war breaks out. We need to heal our country, not by all agreeing the same exact thing, but accepting differing opinions and still love and respecting each other all the same. \n\nThe Problem With the Right: \nNow that I\u2019ve gone onto the main point, it would only be unfair if I didn\u2019t also criticize my party. So as it stands, I have quite a lot of conservative values, and my feed is flooded with conservatives I listen to daily: Michael Knowles, Charlie Kirk, Brett Cooper, Amala Ekpunobi. I think the main problem I have with especially Charlie, but a majority of them is the tendency to use language that is very aggressive. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong to do that on either side, we need people like to educate people who are unsure what side they resonate with. The right, specifically the Christian conservative seemingly tend to be more insistent that their belief systems are the only one that reign supreme. I\u2019m not religious, and I think the Bible does have a lot of good morals for how to live life, but I just can\u2019t get behind people having to stop being gay to stop sinning which is just something I disagree with. I understand why they believe it and as long as they aren\u2019t being hateful or insistent I really have no problem with the way they see the world. The important thing in all of this is we all need to learn to step in each other\u2019s shoes and really think about why other people believe what they do. If you thought you wouldn\u2019t go to heaven because someone was gay and you care about other people, I feel you would also warn others of the dangers, just like non religious people believe that denying who you were born with is detrimental, and you shouldn\u2019t have to stop being gay. That\u2019s the camp I fall into but I still love my friend whose belief system is that gay is a sin and he doesn\u2019t agree with that lifestyle. Let\u2019s all find it in ourselves to listen to each other, state our opinions and disagree with smiles on our faces. \n\n\n\nTLDR: \nWe are American because we are a melting pot of different cultures, values, and lifestyles. If both sides of the political aisle spend their time hating each other because we have different opinions, we are losing sight on what makes America amazing. A differing opinion is not an attack on your moral character or worth, as long as it\u2019s not hateful. Let\u2019s all learn to step in each other\u2019s shoes and listen to each other with genuine curiosity. :)",

What to do and not do. They will touch her belly without permission sometimes. \nThey will ask her a million of personal questions they will not ask the dad.\nThey will judge her whatever her response will be.\nIt\u2019s like being a pregnant woman gives suddenly the right to everybody to rule your life. \nI never have been pregnant but that\u2019s what I saw around me and what I heard from women I know.\n\nAlso, the fact that a lot of male partners are against adoption.\nThe entitlement on their female partner\u2019s body is insane to me.\nThe fact that it has to be THEIR dna in YOUR body when they\u2019re not the one who\u2019s gonna be pregnant and give birth, and most likely not the one who\u2019s gonna do the majority (sometimes even the totality) of the childcare. \nIt makes me feel like they only see their partner as a breeding thing and don\u2019t care about their feelings and their physical health and mental health. \n\nWhen I think about that, it makes sense that being pregnant feels like I would be deprived of my individuality and autonomy. \n\nAnd I started to think the opposite.\nIf I had a man who would make sure that my feelings and worried are taken in consideration and that he doesn\u2019t feel like he has right or entitlement on my body and that ultimately I\u2019m the one who can choose if I want to go through that. It makes me want to rethink my decision.\nIf I know he\u2019s gonna tell people to fuck off when they\u2019re gonna try to touch me or to tell me to quit my job or anything else. If he\u2019s gonna do his dad duties and not feel like he\u2019s \u201cbabysitting\u201d a kid he also wanted and made me go through the whole process for it. Maybe it would easier for me to think about getting pregnant. \n\nIf people stopped seeing women as property, maybe more women wouldn\u2019t feel so repulsed by it.\nI think I see swollen belly as a livestock thing because that\u2019s how they how pregnant women are treated.\n\nI would like to add that not wanting children is also completely ok.\nI think some people want kids and some don\u2019t, and some people have kids when they didn\u2019t want them and some people don\u2019t have kids even though they want to.\nEverybody is different and experience different things and it\u2019s ok.\n\nBut I thought pregnancy looking like livestock is a weird thing and I just wanted to try to understand why it feels like that to me.\n",

Spider-Man is a standard enough concept that there's no reason any part of it has to be tied explicitly to Stan Lee and Steve Ditko.  Star Wars was literally \"I want to make something that recaptures the excitement of old film serials.\"\n\nGood, fine.  Do modern takes on all of those!\n\nBut some works are too specifically a product of a particular person's outlook that when you remove that person, everything falls apart.\n\nA good example is Metal Gear Solid--the Kojima-less entries, while not bad, tend to feel like there's not much that separates them from something like Splinter Cell.  Likewise, I can't imagine Earthbound without Itoi.  Outside of video games, I've seen attempts to adapt Osamu Tezuka stories that end up just reducing his work to standard generic anime when his actual work was anything but.\n\nI would argue Tolkien falls into that as well.  Tolkien was very much a one-of-a-kind, not to be replicated by man or God, and anything he wrote was something *only* he could write.\n\nI've seen again and again what happens when other people try to replicate Tolkien.  The best case study is the original Sword of Shannara novel, which Terry Brooks wrote when he was a teenager and admitted he literally was just aping Lord of the Rings (not that you couldn't tell just from reading the damn book).  And yet despite the obvious similarities, it really does read like just a bland potboiler, devoid of any real substance.  Its a perfect showing of what \"LOTR but not by Tolkien\" would look like.\n\nAnd what it ends up looking like in the hands of less talented creators.  I've never been a fan of the Peter Jackson movies in part because they feel like they're just an episode of Xena Warrior Princess that happens to have Tolkien's names and characters.  The earlier Ralph Bakshi version is closer to the \"feel\" of Tolkien but still gets a lot wrong... and in general, making a Middle-earth movie or TV series really *is* impossible without Tolkien there to oversee the production in person.\n\nWhich is gonna be hard, unless you're willing to perform daily seances in the studio (and considering Tolkien was a religious man he might find such things offensive and refuse to answer anyway).\n\nThe best thing that could happen to Tolkien's legacy is if Warner and whoever else just lost the rights and stopped stamping around in his world, muddying his creation.  Tolkien himself would probably prefer that you use his ideas as a springboard for your own, rather than rely on his name over and over.  \n\nCreate your own world that's already suited to *your* personality.  That's the best way you can be \"like Tolkien.\"",

We all know, most waiters can be whiny little cry babies about getting stiffed, side work, etc. Yet they are some of the most well payed restaurant employees in the industry. Most of the places I have worked at treat waiters like salesman, where they are pushed to sell certain products, whether it be seasonal or new marketing from the corp. \n\nI think that waiters/waitresses, as well as Bartenders, should be paid commission on sales instead of tips from the costumers. It actually incentivizes the waitstaff to sell more, instead of trying to hook up customers for a larger tip %. It puts the onus of the business instead of the customer to pay the waitstaff. They don't even have to put it on the bill as an automatic gratuity, but could put that margin into the price of the food and drinks. ",

        "author": "RProgrammerMan",
        "selftext": "Women are very vulnerable when they are pregnant and when they have to care for small children. As a result women have always expected that men provide for them and protect them from physical danger like wild animals or men with bad intentions. While after the industrial revolution society has become much more complicated, people are still wired with these basic instincts. It is more socially acceptable for women to work a low paying job than it is for men. Men are willing to marry a woman without a career while most women aren't willing to marry a man who hasn't found one. The stakes are much higher for men. There is much more social pressure for men to serve in the military when there is a conflict. Men are shamed for being cowards and for not performing their duty. For example in Ukraine men are being conscripted into the military while women and children flee the country. \n\nGiven women have much less at stake in the economy and in foreign policy is it really ethical that they have so much say in these matters? Currently more women vote than men. Men choose to work longer hours, higher paying and more dangerous occupations. Men are less empathetic and physically stronger making them better soldiers and killers. Many women see voting as a way to extract resources from men. They vote for government benefits so they do not have to marry a man but can instead rely on taxes taken from men working difficult jobs. With women voting we have divorce laws that greatly benefit women at the expense of men. This dynamic undermines the family and hurts the children in many cases. It creates an incentive to live unhealthy lifestyles and makes men second class citizens compared to women.\n\nThere's a strong case to be made that the biggest problems in society would be better if only married men voted. Namely, bad economies, war and broken families. Limiting the vote to only married men rewards men for providing for women and supporting families. It would produce a society that incentivizes family and sustainable lifestyles. It also means women get to determine whether a man is an upstanding member of society and should get a vote. All this gets at another unpopular truth which is that men and women play different roles in society.",

        "selftext": "Lots of Right-Wing Parties around the world claim to be concerned about Islam and Sharia Law taking over the world because they supposedly find it incompatible. This sub isn't immune to it as well. But I find their take on this topic pretty hypocritical because most of their beliefs and parties' platforms are in line with it.\n\nThey believe in Government based on Religion and don't believe in Separation of Church and State calling it a Leftist Myth. Many Right-Wing politicians even admitted to holding such a belief. Hence, they want Religion taught in schools, which has been proven to be true just recently. They want Abortion outlawed as well, particularly the Abortion Bans in many US states that are being implemented. Not to mention a high emphasis on Traditional Gender Roles and Marriage as they find certain Gay Marriage Bills to be unconstitutional for infringing on their right to Free Will and wanting to abolish it. Not to mention they place a high emphasis on Masculinity as they criticize Toxic Feminism. I mean, just check out Project 2025 and see for yourself. Many Right-Wing tried to deny it despite many prominent Right-Wing Politicians and Activists taking part of its creation.\n\nSo this is why I find this hypocritical that many Right-Wing Parties complain about Islam and Sharia Law taking over when they believe and implement much of the same thing. As a matter of fact, take a look at many Right-Wing Parties in Islamic Countries and you can see for yourself that they believe in virtually the same thing as they do. But they're too stupid to realize, let alone admit that. But hey, what do you expect from Parties that are filled with retarded White Evangelical Asshats? If that offends them, too bad. Because it's the truth. And if they start leaving the parties if they start reaching out to Muslims, then that's a good sign. If I were head of such party, I would do that. And I am not ashamed to admit it. Because the days of pandering to Whites and Evangelicals has to come to an end. You've been pandered to enough. What more do you want? No, it's not racist, bigoted, let alone Anti-White and Anti-Christian to admit that Right-Wing Parties are overwhelming White and Evangelical. Just take a look at so many pictures of them. You don't need a flash camera to see for yourself. The Parties will benefit tremendously without your involvement.\n\nSo word of advice, shut up and get some self-awareness. You'll need it.",

        "selftext": "First of all, let me just say that Antisemitism is by far shameful, disgusting, and reprehensible on so many levels. And with the ongoing crisis in the Middle East, it's heartbreaking to explain it into words. I'm not Jewish but any means, I happen to be Muslim. And yes, as expected, I do have a slight Pro-Palestinian bent but I want the best of both worlds. I believe in a two-state solution, particularly one that's in line with the 1967 borders. The attacks by Hamas on Israel was heartbreaking and unjustifiable. But at the same time, Israel's collective punishment on innocent Palestinian civilians particularly in Gaza was just as heartbreaking and unjustifiable.\n\nWhen it comes to hate crimes in the United States particularly in the modern era, you'd expect it be mostly Muslim due to the aftermath of 9/11 and many other incidents like that. And yes, it's true. They do exist. But according to FBI statistics, the victims are mostly Jewish and what's going in the Middle East is only amplifying it.\n\n[https://www.justice.gov/crs/highlights/2022-hate-crime-statistics](https://www.justice.gov/crs/highlights/2022-hate-crime-statistics)\n\nEven with that said, I think the elephant in the room needs to be addressed. Despite not being predominantly Jewish and even prior to these attacks, the US takes Antisemitism much more seriously than any other form of hate out there. And it's not just racial but religious as well. If you say anything Antisemitic even if it's constructive, you suffer severe consequences. You get silenced, lose employment, and be financially crippled for life.\n\nMeanwhile, say something racist, bigoted, homophobic, and transphobic about Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs, Gays, Lesbians, and Transgender people, you won't face any severe consequences. In fact, it won't be on the front page of the newspaper. Take a look at a lot of Right-Wing Media and see for yourself how they view many of those Minorities. Most of the time, it's barely positive.\n\nOne example that fits the premise of how the US, especially the American Right are selective when it comes to combatting hate is someone I've been mentioning quite often on this subreddit when I make posts regarding certain social issues. That person is obviously Candace Owens. As hypocritical as I find her to be and nothing will ever change that opinion regardless of what stance she takes even if it's something I share with her on, it's interesting how she was able to get away with making incendiary comments about the Black community while getting penalized for doing the exact same thing towards the Jewish community. Oh, and as a matter of fact, she actually admitted to dunking on the Black community during her tenure at the Daily Wire from 2021-2024 after many people noticed the contrasting reception from users regarding her toxic rhetoric towards both groups even before being employed there.\n\n[https://x.com/RealCandaceO/status/1825285932641382798](https://x.com/RealCandaceO/status/1825285932641382798)\n\n[https://atlantablackstar.com/2024/08/20/candace-owens-says-she-was-encouraged-to-talk-badly-about-black-people-after-recent-backlash-over-israel-comments/](https://atlantablackstar.com/2024/08/20/candace-owens-says-she-was-encouraged-to-talk-badly-about-black-people-after-recent-backlash-over-israel-comments/)\n\n[https://waynedupree.com/2024/08/Owens-Sparks-Controversy-with-Accusations-Against-Zionists-and-Israel](https://waynedupree.com/2024/08/Owens-Sparks-Controversy-with-Accusations-Against-Zionists-and-Israel)\n\nSo yes, it's safe to say that Antisemitism is taken much more seriously than any other form of hate in the US. And I'm not saying that we should stop being against it. But at the same time, Constructive Criticism of Israel and how its government is conducting the war should be put into question because they've been making their fair share of wrongdoings and mistakes. Just because we're allies with a certain country doesn't mean that said country should be immune from criticism. Look at Saudi Arabia. That's another important US ally in the Middle East and we engage with them on many issues such as Oil, Trade, Military Defense, Foreign Policy, and its creeping alliance with Israel yet we criticize them for their fair share of wrongdoings, such as Human Rights.\n\nThat being said, all forms of hate need to be condemned equally. After all, all lives matter, right? Yeah. As a matter of fact, the people who support All Lives Matter don't seem to apply it to everyone, particularly when it comes to Israelis and Palestinians.",

        "author": "TheLordRebukeYou",
        "selftext": "You read that right. Abortion, more specifically any changes to the current Federal framework for addressing abortion since the reversal of Roe v Wade, are not on the ballot this November.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause neither side, pro-life nor pro-choice, has 60 votes in the Senate.\n\nIn order to take a bill from the floor of the Senate, to a vote, you must file a motion for 'Cloture.'\n\nYou must close the debate, then vote on the bill. That requires 60 votes in the Senate to overcome the Senate filibuster.\n\nThe Senate filibuster is a procedural tactic used by U.S. senators to delay or block legislative action, typically by extending debate on a bill. A filibuster can take various forms, including long speeches, offering numerous amendments, or any other means that prevent a vote on a bill or a nomination from happening in a timely manner. The practice arises because Senate rules allow for unlimited debate unless a supermajority agrees to cut it off.\n\nTo overcome a filibuster and bring debate to an end, the Senate uses a **motion for cloture**. Here\u2019s how the process works:\n\n1. **Filing for Cloture**: To break a filibuster, a senator can file a motion for cloture. This motion requires the support of at least **16 senators** to be formally submitted.\n2. **Waiting Period**: After the cloture motion is filed, the Senate must wait **two legislative days** before the cloture vote can take place. This allows for continued debate and time for senators to deliberate.\n3. **Cloture Vote**: For the cloture motion to pass, at least **three-fifths (60 out of 100 senators)** must vote in favor. This 60-vote threshold ensures that a substantial minority can continue debate if they are not satisfied with the legislation or nomination.\n4. **Post-Cloture Debate**: If the cloture motion passes, debate on the bill is limited to **30 additional hours**. During this period, senators can still discuss the bill, but it is clear that a final vote will occur after this time runs out.\n5. **Final Vote**: After the post-cloture debate period concludes, the Senate can proceed to a final vote on the bill or nomination. At this point, only a **simple majority (51 votes)** is needed to pass the bill, assuming all senators are present.\n\nThe filibuster makes it difficult to pass legislation without bipartisan support, particularly in a closely divided Senate.\n\nSo in the debate when Kamala said she would \"sign that bill\" - what bill was she talking about? Certainly not one that has any chance of ever hitting a President's desk.\n\nSimply put, she was lying for votes from rubes.\n\nFor his part, [Trump could not be more clear that he would not sign a national abortion ban](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1841295548109955091), in fact he says he would veto one if it came to his desk! \n\n>[Donald J. Trump](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1841295548109955091) [u/realDonaldTrump](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump) **EVERYONE KNOWS I WOULD NOT SUPPORT A FEDERAL ABORTION BAN, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, AND WOULD, IN FACT, VETO IT, BECAUSE IT IS UP TO THE STATES TO DECIDE BASED ON THE WILL OF THEIR VOTERS (THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE!). LIKE RONALD REAGAN BEFORE ME, I FULLY SUPPORT THE THREE EXCEPTIONS FOR RAPE, INCEST, AND THE LIFE OF THE MOTHER. I DO NOT SUPPORT THE DEMOCRATS RADICAL POSITION OF LATE TERM ABORTION LIKE, AS AN EXAMPLE, IN THE 7TH, 8TH, OR 9TH MONTH OR, IN CASE THERE IS ANY QUESTION, THE POSSIBILITY OF EXECUTION OF THE BABY AFTER BIRTH. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER!**\n\nAbortion remains the largest single issue for unmarried, single women who are likely voters.\n\nHowever, because of the rules of the Senate, it's simply a lie to tell these women that abortion is on the Federal ballot this November. \n\nVoters in at least 10 states, including Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New York, Nevada, and South Dakota, will decide on measures that could expand or restrict abortion rights. These measures range from proposals to protect abortion access, like in Maryland and Nevada, to more restrictive proposals, such as limiting abortion rights in states like Nebraska.\n\nThat's all at the State level. Which is exactly where and how this question should be getting handled. At the State level.",

        "author": "CAustin3",
        "selftext": "I read the opposite opinion here a day or two ago that received almost universal praise and agreement, so here's the actual unpopular opinion (at least among the Reddit demographic).\n\nThere was a time when school prepared you for the factory.  About 100-150 years ago, in the middle of the Industrial Revolution, when the economies they supported were undergoing a massive shift from agriculture to industry.  Even then, the great crime of the schools?  Teaching kids the three R's (reading, writing, and arithmetic), which happened to be handy for reading instruction manuals and maintaining machines.\n\nAt the century-old time when this criticism was at its most valid, the complaint was that schools were teaching us to *read* and *add*.  How dehumanizing!\n\nBack then, public schools were often called \"grammar schools,\" because that's most of what they taught.  Since then, we've added years to free education, including things like education on how government works, enough advanced math and science to be able to understand some of the modern world without having to be a physicist, classes like health and sex ed that are purely for the well-being of the student, and similar classes that prepare you for all kinds of lives and interests beyond the rote learning of a few specific skills.\n\nMany modern standards are specifically written around critical thinking.  In your English classes, you're specifically given reading from things that governments wanted censored and controlled at some point.  If you've ever been assigned George Orwell or Ray Bradbury or Mark Twain to read, unless you slept through class, you'd better not be accusing your school of trying to train you for obedience instead of critical thinking.\n\nIn your math classes, federal and state standards mandate that you're not just trained to follow an algorithm to solve equations, but pushed to see connections between graphical, algebraic, and tabular representations of data and patterns to see and evaluate multiple approaches to understanding and analyzing things.\n\nOn top of all that, schools offer electives and extracurriculars so that you can specifically tailor your education to your intent for your life and get hands-on experience with things that are otherwise extracted.  Did you run for school government?  Join the debate team?\n\nSo, what gives?  Why do so many Redditors parrot the \"schools are stifling you and training you to be an unthinking corporate drone\" line?  Partially, ironically, because they're mindlessly repeating something they learned by rote and not bothering to think about it.\n\nBut more, because they were offered all these opportunities, and instead chose to do the bare minimum, take advantage of no opportunities that required work on their part, and half-assed even the things they were required to do, which sucks all the meaning out of them (it's hard to learn from George Orwell if you didn't read the book and copied the assignment from your buddy).\n\nThey have some heavily-revised memory of getting sent to detention that they've stayed bitter about their whole lives (in their mind, it was because they were challenging the status quo, but it was actually because they were trying to get a reaction out of the autistic kid by chucking erasers at his head during math class), and now they eagerly suck up any rhetoric that says the reason they're an unambitious drone is because school made them one, not because they didn't apply themselves.\n\nSo no.  If you got drone training out of public education instead of taking advantage of all the thought-challenging classes, hands-on opportunities, and chances to do creative and new things that modern public education showers you with, that's on you.",

It\u2019s part of a broader phenomenon of non-confrontation, but that\u2019s a topic for another day.\n\nI will preface this by saying that this is only relevant when someone specifically asks for your opinion, not unsolicited advice - that\u2019s an important distinction to make between being brutally honest and an asshole.\n\nFor example, if somebody is morbidly obese and depressed as a result and tells you that, lying to them and telling them they\u2019re the most beautiful thing on earth since Marilyn and that they should be a supermodel is terrible advice. It\u2019s just objectively not true that the vast majority of people are going to find you attractive, and I think advice like go to the gym, lose weight, find a physical hobby etc. is far more beneficial to the person in the long run - as long as it\u2019s coming from a good place. You *should* want your friends to be on a constant journey of self improvement, and lying to them does nothing but delude them and hinder that progress - especially if they start to drink the Kool-Aid.\n\nIn my own experience, I had a friend in college who was absolutely obsessed with this girl. Like to an unhealthy point. After she rejected him, he got into all this manosphere bullshit, kept saying bullshit like \u201cgirls don\u2019t like him because he\u2019s short!!!\u201d. My other friends were almost mollycoddling him, telling him that\u2019s it okay and he\u2019s perfect and shouldn\u2019t change for a girl. When he asked me, I took him to task tbh. I told him that he can keep blaming the world for his problems like a bitchboy, or he can get up, pick up a hobby, hit the gym/start a sport, actually become interesting to women, and stop putting pussy on the pedestal. All this manosphere bullshit is doing for you is making you less and less desirable to 99% of normal women. He did take it well, to his credit. He wrote to me recently (we live in different cities now) thanking me for that, he\u2019s doing a lot better, has a great girl, and is absolutely loving making money from his hobbies - actually the reason I thought to make this post.\n\nSometimes people need to hear the truth, no matter how uncomfortable it is to say.

One of my favorite couples have been together through high school and now college and they are very independent people with very different lives but they love each other very dearly and would never change one another.\nBut even the long distance relationships I\u2019ve seen in college are mostly really controlling if they\u2019re together after their freshman year. They won\u2019t let them have friends of the opposite sex, they\u2019re suspicious of them, track them constantly, and criticize them. My roommate wholeheartedly believes she will be with her boyfriend forever, and that worries me a lot. Because of him, she barely goes out and he yells at her whenever she\u2019s with a male friend and so she\u2019ll lie to him about where she is and who she\u2019s with. She thinks it\u2019s not okay for him to have female friends and although she\u2019s not close with any guys, she\u2019ll hide the fact that she has male friends. She also doesn\u2019t let him go out even though she does (which in her argument she says that girls go out for their friends, guys mostly go out to get girls which is kind of fair).\nI know if they broke up, she would be way more mature because the new pool of guys she would be interacting with would mostly say she\u2019s toxic. They also would probably dislike her insistence that traditional relationships and marriages are the only way to go. \nA lot of people I know who have only had one person will criticize the fact that I let my boyfriend have female friends, that I don\u2019t need him to call me everyday even though we\u2019re in a LDR, and I\u2019m fine with him going to parties!\nIn conclusion, I think people who have been with one main person usually are very immature and toxic because they\u2019ve never had any healthy experience before and are too insecure to leave. \n",

        "selftext": "While the stereotype is pretty common, most people will still backpedal with \"But every country has stupid people\", and \"Every country has problems\". I'm not backpedaling. The stereotype is warranted.\n\n**1. Lack of education**\n\nThe most commonly brought up factor, and I just want to glance over it very briefly. They can't read and write their own language properly (they're/their, \"should of\", ...), their high school / college level stuff is what other countries' schools do in middle school.\n\n**2. Buzzword culture**\n\nBe it political words like \"liberal\", or \"woke\", or various \"isms\", or \"phobias\", or other buzzwords. For an American, words have no meaning, and they like throwing around buzzwords at people randomly like poop in a bag.\n\n**3. They are angry, violent and prone to tantrums over the most mundane things like toddlers**\n\nWe all know the \"Karen\" videos of middle-aged Americans being overly loud and angry at people over the most mundane things. My experience with Americans is that they're overly angry, or get very angry over the most mundane things. They also love seeking / fabricating confrontation and playing the victim.\n\nWhen I have discussions online about anything, maybe I have a differing opinion about something, or present a different fact that either agrees or disagrees with what someone is saying, there will always be someone who gets unreasonably angry, takes it personally, will go out of his/her way to seek confrontation on a personal level and to misinterpret what you're saying and to fabricate drama, be very loud about how they've been \"attacked\" / \"victimised\" and how \"rude\" and \"mean\" you are for having stated the most mundane of opinions, and demand you apologise. If you know, you know.\n\nThat person is very likely American, and that seems to be normal behaviour in that culture.\n\nWhen you see a video of a grown person throwing a tantrum at a service worker for saying \"Sorry, we don't have that available\", then claiming to have been \"attacked\", fabcriating drama and being very loud about it, you can safely assume that person is American, because this is how they behave.\n\nMy interactions with Americans have generally been very unpleasant, for reasons mentioned above, because they love confrontation and drama too much.\n\n**4. They are professional victims**\n\nI already mentioned some of this in 3., but it deserves an extra point. In addition, according to the internet, suddenly everybody has ADHD/autism/bipolar disorder/anxiety/dyslexia/whatever else now, and they love plastering their profiles with the diagnosis they have given themselves.\n\n**5. They lack humour, have a stick up their butts and get offended over the smallest things**\n\nI saw a video of a young girl (gen / alpha?) poking fun of habits of millennials in a lighthearted way. I am a millennial, I am aware that I belong to the older generation from their point of view, and it reminded me of how our generation poked fun at boomers for thinking we are geniuses for connecting a router, or converting files.\n\nHer comment section went wild, people were genuinely angry and riled up, how dare she be so mean to them. This reminds me of other interactions with Americans, and I generally avoid them, or walk on eggshells so they don't get \"offended\" over the smallest things.\n\n**6. Weird customs**\n\nThey bathe and declaw their cats. It warrants an extra point.\n\n**7. Oversexualisation and grooming of girls**\n\nThey groom girls into commodifying themselves from a very early age. They glamourise being on OF, they chant \"sex work is work\" and pretend it's \"empowering\" to be a commodity with no recognised rights to be abused, being a \"bad bitch\", their media is weirdly obsessed with sexualising teenage girls (Teen is the most popular category on PHub, shows like Euphoria and GoT contribute as well). For a country that's associated with \"purity\" culture, they're weirdly (teen girl) porn obsessed.\n\n--\n\nI haven't experienced any other people to be so vulgar and aggressive, drama-seeking and confrontational, stick-in-the-butt and entitled. Not to that degree. My experiences with Americans (on and offline) have always been \"walking on eggshells\".\n\nI always found it curious how every American online claims to have anxiety, but I sympathise now. It's no surprise, really. My interactions with Americans made me feel anxiety too, imagine being surrounded by them everyday.",

It's always this narrative that they are victims of their circumstances and it is really society that made them this way.\n\nThere is some truth to that; I do think being considered a golden child would impart some unrealistic expectations, but what is ridiculous to me is saying that you're robbed of your ability to study. Studying is basically just work. You need to put in effort to read your textbooks, do the worksheets, attend your class, etc. It's literally effort manifest. Some people need to study more to get the same results, but that just means you have to try harder. \n\nThese people are not unable to study. They are afraid to study. More specifically, they are afraid of putting in effort. A huge part of being gifted is the idea that they can learn faster, quicker and with less effort than their peers. They stay so long in denial that their gifts are unable to carry them anymore, that sometimes, they just never overcome it. There's a sense of ego that is tied to the effortless nature of being gifted, and trying hard means acknowledging that their gifts no longer have meaning. \n\nThere is value in dissecting the problems that gifted kids go through, but I feel like a lot of it is a crutch. 'Gifted kid' content externalizes the problems, wherein it makes it a societal issue, which is not entirely false, but made waaaay too important. Because a common thread I noticed is that even after consuming this content, ex gifted kids still continue down the same path that brought them to ruin. There's still an undercurrent of ego that they cling to, and they still do things like skip classes and not studying until the last minute. Attending classes is not a skill. Dedicating an hour a day to self study is not a skill. It's a self perpetuating cycle of \"I can't study because I was gifted\" and \"I'm  gifted so I won't study\"and it ends with them just not studying.",

When I saw truly mainstream, I don't mean you have to be a juggernaut like Coldplay. Bands like 3 Doors Down, Good Charlotte, Jimmy Eat World, Evanescence, Puddle of Mudd, Sum 41, etc. were \"mainstream popular\". We know what they look like, they have some radio staples. This is something you can't say about recent bands. We just don't get new bands who even just drop 3 top 50 hits and make some memorable music videos and then fade out.\n\nSo when was the last time we had one of those? Imagine Dragons is a big mainstream band no matter what you say about them, however their first album was in 2012. Mumford, Florence, Vampire Weekend date back to 2000s. Bands like the Lumineers and the 1975 that would be borderline for mainstream relevance anyway are still 2012/2013.\n\nThe normie explanation for this is that well, over time people's taste change. Just like how the popular movie genres 20-30 years ago were different like R rated comedies and adult thrillers and stuff. But, I think this is weirder. Because rock music should be protected by variability in genre. Motley Crue, Nirvana, Matchbox 20 have nothing in common with each other music wise, hence logically, this should've protected it. Hard rock goes out of style, well girls still like the band with handsome guy singing radio friendly pop ballad. Which is exactly what happened most of history. But somehow, none of them are popular anymore. There's no bands at all really even if you stretch rock definition, no new Maroon 5 (they've been around as long as Avril Lavigne and still seem chart relevant). There is not too many rap groups, but I think that happened by 2000s.\n\nTherefore, my theory is the explanation must go beyond generational taste change, it's about change in views towards white guy-isms, masculinity, lesser socialization, etc. Yes in another decade perhaps Lewis Capaldi would've released Someone You Loved as a Good Goo Dolls type of band, but in this era it made more sense to be a solo artist, although it's not like there's been tons of hits like that which you could envision released as a band, no individual version of rock stars. Maybe people who are really collectivist about society and into \"The big group\" see less meaning in \"the small group\" of 4-5 bandmates if that makes sense. Hence why for example internet sites with millions of users like reddit and twitter are popular and little enclaves on the internet like personalized forums are less popular. ",

        "selftext": "Here are the Basic Step to follow \nSTEP 1: Prepare Yourself\nUnderstand how semen retention actually works. You can\u2019t just sit around and not ejaculate for 20 days and expect to manifest a Ferrari. Spend some time with this guide to understand all of the important pieces.\n\nRemember that you have to do practices to integrate (transmute) the increased sexual charge that comes from not ejaculating, and then use that integrated charge as fuel for taking action in the world. These actions are the things that change your life (literal semen buildup in your groin won\u2019t turn you into a super hero).\n\nSTEP 2: Get Guidance\nLearn from someone who has successfully done this practice before. At least read the books both Ancient & New Age although Information is Quite Similar you'll get a wider perspective on the problems you face. \nFor Example new age Book : Masturbation Misery by Rion Emperor explains 500 real life experience while Julian Lees book Explains everything about Sexual Alchemy both of which are Important for your Growth in this Journey as Gita Says \" Knowledge is Power \" \n\nThis is serious stuff we\u2019re working with here, and it deserves serious effort. Don\u2019t try to do it alone.\n\nSTEP 3: Start With a Realistic Goal\nMake sure your goal is actually attainable. If you regularly ejaculate multiple times per week, don\u2019t try to immediately go 30 days without ejaculating. Instead, you could commit to just 7 days, because you WILL experience noteworthy benefits during that time. Attempting to go for longer periods of time in the beginning could be a recipe for failure & disappointment.\n\nMy recommendation would be to go for 10 days for your first time. That way you have at least 3 days to experience the benefits of the spike in testosterone levels that happens on the 7th day post-ejaculation.\n\nSTEP 4: Have Compassion for Yourself\nThis journey isn\u2019t always easy at first, and you\u2019re not living in a society that supports this kind of intentional living. 99.5% of society is focused on instant gratification (what I call \u201cejaculation culture\u201d), and most people are so brainwashed by this that the idea of cultivating your own life force sounds overly new age or pseudoscientific.\n\nYou\u2019re bound to make some slip-ups along the way, and it\u2019s important that when you do, you have compassion for yourself in this journey of growth and sexual mastery. Shame and self-loathing is one of the worst things you can do.",

Because we are so used to avatars, we believe we are things that we are not. The fantasy world and reality now have a solid and consistently used bridge to one another. People really think things that are logically devoid of logic, are logical. This aspect of progressivism is on par with the fantasy elements of the Salem Witch trials, where people in the future will look back like, \"Wow, people actually believed that stuff?\"\n\nI think the antidote to this possible problem is to admit that these progressive beliefs are philosophies and not universal truths. A truth claim requires solid evidence, not left up to interpretation. You let go of an apple on Earth, without the influence of technology, it's going to fall, regardless of how it makes you feel. Whether the apple falling makes you laugh or cry, it doesn't matter, it falls. Now, you can be poetic and say that the apple is reuniting with the ground because it misses it, adding personification. There's nothing wrong with that but when you try to claim that as a truth rather than a metaphor or philosophy, it becomes a problem. \n\nWhen it comes to Nazism, that parallel is in regards to censorship of those who choose to question or speak up and challenge the progressive beliefs of today. You get banned, blocked, canceled, deleted, silenced, etc. for simply discussing the topics at hand, objectively. It's because, like Nazis, some progressives only want to be heard and obeyed. They do not care for critique or questions because they have an ego issue. You question Hitler's motives with a good question, they won't care, the SS will persecute you. \n\nThese are the two core reasons why I think today's progressivism is going to be an embarassing moment in history for those in the future looking back.",

        "author": "Neat_Economics5190",
        "selftext": "**INTRO**\n\nAs a Christian, I agree a lot with the feminist movement in regards to desexualizing games. I feel like the core focus of games should be \"play\", the \"fun factor\" and not stray away into other categories. I feel like games now focus too much on;\n\n* sex sells\n* cinematics\n* political views\n* SDGs (wokeness)\n* microtransactions\n* etc.\n\nToo many other things that have NOTHING to do with gaming in it's truth! So in that small area of feminism in gaming, I agree. I think focusing on \"sex sell\" alongside the other categories divert the focus from play to other things that have nothing to do with gaming, thus destroying gaming.\n\nI am not saying the artist cannot have appealing characters! I am saying that the focus with games should be \"PLAY.\" Is it fun? Can you pop it in and have a good time? Is the core focus, play? Can I spend 30 minutes in your game and have fun without influence of the story? \n\nTo me, games are like toys, action figures, but in a virtual world. They are meant for play. \n\n**WHY IS FEMINISM IN GAMING EVIL?**\n\nNow that you see that I am not whatever you probably was going to label as (you hate women and objectify them blah blah blaaaah!) I may finally answer why feminism in gaming is evil.\n\nBack when gaming and nerd culture was considered \"loser s\\*\\*t\", guys used to catch hell from some people for having a habby of playing Dungeons and Dragons, playing videogames, playing Pokemon or Yugioh. Nerd culture was looked down upon by the masses until the 2010's. Like, it was fine for kids and such to be in it, but adults into it... let's say the vibe of buying a game or pokemon cards was the same as buying a dirty tape at the video store. It's very low key. It's like buying drugs or something. \n\nThe \"popular kids\" and popular guys called us all kinds of \"nerd, geek, dorks\" etc in high school, college, whatever. Gamers were social outcasts to some extent. \n\nThat said, in the past, 90s and prior, young boys, young men, we made up the vast majority of geeks and gamers. While in school, being disrespected by all the girls and popular guys, we hung out with our friends and some of us decided to get into the gaming industry. Others got into comics, others anime, etc. In our rooms, we fantasized about going on great adventures where we take down tyrants and dragons. ART IS A CONFESSION. What ever is within, we put it into our art be it drawing, music, poetry, whatever. Art comes from within. \n\nSo on paper, the women we fantasize about, we draw. We are horny and young and going through putberty and a high sex drive but no woman will give us the time of day because we don't play ball or aren't \"cool.\" So we illustrate our fantasies, sell our stories, and our fantasies become popular characters. We put ourselves into our protagonists, thus most protagonists being muscular heroic males. \n\nNow that our series, games, anime, etc blows up, becomes popular, suddenly all the women who were gone are at our doorstep demanding a spot in our company to change it into their image and what they want?\n\nCan you see the problem here?\n\nFeminism in gaming and in media in general has some legitimacy to it because people do outright use sex to sell. Hollywood 101. But it's evil because it demonizes males for being male. i presumes we are evil for confessing what we cannot have, and relating to others who buy our content because they feel the same way. \n\nIt's evil becuase of the lack of empathy. A lot of gaming feminists and anime feminists and such never stop tot hink about the authors or developers and what they been through. All they have is this selfish victim mentality where they are the victim and the evil world is after them. that creates rage within thus why the \"angry feminist\" stereotype is a thing. \n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFeminists in gaming lack empathy and understanding. Times changed rapidly, and the old nerd culture and new nerd culture are clashing int his culture war becuase of it. All i'm saying is try to understand one another before firing shots.\n\nThank you for reading and take care.\n\nLeave your comments below and remember reddit's rule of \"Remember the Human.\"\n\n",

        "author": "winryoma",
        "selftext": "The introduction of synthetic chemicals to one's skin can be argued to prompt a rejection of our natural state. The anus, a part of the human body often deemed dirty, is posited to be intended to be enjoyed in its unadulterated, natural condition. In the past, humans relied on river water without the abundance of chemical products like body wash, shampoo, and conditioner. Despite these limited resources, historical humans successfully reproduced without resorting to concealing themselves behind artificially scented substances. This prompts the question: why the contemporary inclination to use such products? Perhaps the enjoyment of this particular body part in its natural state could be seen as more logical. Analogous to individuals who appreciate the natural scent of a vagina rather than an artificial fragrance, a similar approach might be taken for the anus.\n\nExploring this involves delving into the historical context of hygiene practices and the evolution of societal attitudes towards bodily functions. In ancient times, reliance on natural water sources was out of necessity, and the lack of advanced personal care products did not hinder the basic functions of reproduction or overall health. The argument extends to the premise that modern reliance on chemical-laden products represents a departure from our natural state, suggesting a societal shift in perceptions of cleanliness and acceptability.\n\nMoreover, it can be argued that the current obsession with scented hygiene products is a result of societal pressures and marketing influences. Advertisements often portray the use of such products as essential for personal well-being and social acceptance. This, in turn, may contribute to a perceived need for individuals to mask their natural scents, including those associated with the anus. The argument then raises questions about the authenticity of these preferences and the societal constructs that shape them.\n\nIn examining the historical and cultural aspects of hygiene practices, one must also consider the diversity of perspectives on cleanliness and what is deemed acceptable. Different cultures throughout history have had varying standards of hygiene, with some emphasizing natural bodily processes over the use of chemical products. This cultural relativism challenges the universality of contemporary hygiene norms and encourages a reconsideration of what is truly necessary for maintaining health and well-being.\n\nThe discussion on the natural state of the anus and the human body as a whole can be expanded to include the broader discourse on body positivity. Embracing one's natural features, scents, and bodily functions challenges societal norms and fosters a more inclusive and accepting environment. Advocates for natural hygiene argue that accepting and appreciating our bodies as they are can lead to a more genuine and liberated sense of self.\n\nthe argument against the use of scented hygiene products for the anus stems from a perspective that values the natural state of the human body. This viewpoint draws on historical practices, questions societal influences, and promotes body positivity and acceptance. By delving into the intricacies of hygiene norms, cultural diversity, and personal preferences, we can gain a deeper understanding of the evolving relationship between humans and their bodies.",

Even when the debate had loaded questions they spoke their peace and move on to the next subject. My favorite part though had to be the respect they had for one another. They did not call each other names, nor did they call their Presidential running mate insults (showing respect for the other admin even when they weren't present). At the end they were shaking hands and laughing as they left the debate stage and I have not seen that since Obama and Romeny. \n\nThis debate really open my eyes in ways that I did not see either candidate before. I watch the entire debate and was honestly upset it ended so soon. I wanted to hear more about each candidate policy meanwhile I could hardly force myself to watch the presidential debate because it was a clown show. It a real shame the live streams only had a 1/10 of the viewership. Hearing the two potential VP discuss really made me wish they were the ones running for president instead of Trump and Kamala. ",

The people who put their age and sex in their posts are usually leveraging social biases to increase how much viewers care about their problem.\n\nYou can tell by looking at who posts their age/sex which demographic groups get a free boost to how much redditors care about their problems. The answer is women and teenagers. Men basically never announce themselves as men, except sometimes when they're under 18 and are claiming credit for doing an adult thing as a child. You can also tell in the comments section of a (25F)-type post that the general tone is usually safe praise and zero negative feedback. This is not the way that standard posts (which I guess are assumed default male) get treated.\n\nI don't really care that women and teenagers get special access to extra help and praise, but I do mind that it's against the rules to mention that this is what's happening. Nobody, especially the commenters giving head pats, want to admit they're doing it because the poster is young or female. Admitting they are coddling is a huge blow another thing that redditors beleive, which is that women are powerful and tough and need no special care.\n\nI'm happy to live in a community that acts as if women are just as tough as men, and I'm also happy to live in a community that acts as if women need special care. I'm not happy to live to a community that believes both at once and shouts down anyone who points this out.",

I don't understand how that was such a masterfully crafted joke?? It didn't even illicit a laugh or a chuckle out of me the two times I saw it. \n\nTo summarize, I don't find Smiling Friends funny.

        "selftext": "The term \"toxic masculinity\" originated in the 1980s by the mythopoetic men\u2019s movement, which focused on New Age religion, mythology, and imitation of Native American rituals. Figures like Robert Bly believed men had lost touch with their true nature due to societal pressures, leading to traits like aggression, dominance, and emotional repression. These ideas were not rooted in scientific research but instead relied on religious philosophy and personal, speculative interpretations of societal problems.\n\nAs the term gained traction in academic circles, R.W. Connell and Michael Kimmel expanded on these concepts with similarly unscientific approaches. Connell\u2019s idea of \"hegemonic masculinity\" suggested that society idealized certain harmful traits in men, while Kimmel focused on how young men were socialized into behaviors like entitlement and aggression. Both scholars similarly made their conclusions based personal, speculative interpretations of societal problems, rather than justifying their claims with empirical research. Despite lacking scientific grounding, \"toxic masculinity\" became a widely accepted critique of men\u2019s behavior, and its use expanded into mainstream discourse during movements like #MeToo.\n\nHowever, labeling an entire identity group as \"toxic\" (even partially) is deeply bigoted. Terms like \"toxic masculinity\" unfairly generalize negative behaviors and suggest they are inherent or exclusive to men as a group. If we were to apply this logic to other identity groups\u2014such as labeling \"toxic blackness\" to critique certain behaviors in the Black community or \"toxic Jewishness\" to describe traits among Jewish people\u2014these labels would immediately be condemned as racist and anti-Semitic. Just as with these examples, attaching \"toxic\" to any identity group based on the behavior of some members perpetuates harmful stereotypes and unfairly stigmatizes the entire group. It is also not grounded in any sound science. \n\nIn essence, labeling any group or identity as \"toxic\" is both unscientific and bigoted. It reduces complex social behaviors to simplistic and harmful narratives, reinforcing prejudices rather than fostering constructive critique. We need to move beyond these divisive labels and address specific behaviors without unfairly stigmatizing entire groups based solely on their identity.",

If Kamala wins, the entire country will be overrun by illegals. If Trump wins, democracy will literally end and we will be living in North Korea writ large. It\u2019s unlikely that either of these are true, but that\u2019s what the vast majority of people believe, and frankly even as someone who is skeptical of both of these claims, seeing them is really exhausting, especially given that I have my own things to worry about.\n\nI don\u2019t know if the idea that the presidency can do literally everything is founded or not. But our mental health will be a lot better if people weren\u2019t so obsessed with everything that happens in Washington DC. And as long as a federal government continues to wield so much (perceived, perhaps) influence over two vastly different populations (we got to be honest, that\u2019s what we are), our nation\u2019s mental health crisis will worsen. A country cannot stay together if most people perceive it as sort of this half colonizer half colonized state.\n\nIf Texas feels like the federal government isn\u2019t defending the border enough, it should be able to act on its own. Massachusetts should be able to do whatever it wants, tax people to implement single payer healthcare or build the Acela that it wants. Maybe this isn\u2019t a perfect solution. I think letting states decide abortion is a step in the right direction, But it sure beats 70-80 million Americans totally losing their minds every 4 years. Perhaps if something has sufficient national consensus across the vast majority of states, something can be done. But we can\u2019t have things done by simple majorities that could easily be erased by the next government. This isn\u2019t a way to run a country.\n\nEdit: one of the few things that the central government should make sure of is the military, foreign policy, disaster relief, and a basic level of civil rights (the Civil Rights Act, perhaps Title IX and the Respect for Marriage Act). States would contribute a certain share based on current levels of federal spending on these areas and their economies as a share of the national economy. and Other than that, tax revenues and such should go to the states so Medicare and Medicaid can be run by the states-they could do single payer if they want to.",

        "author": "StatisticianGreat514",
        "selftext": "**CAUTION: LONG POST**\n\nFor decades, Republicans have struggled greatly in capturing a significant portion of the Minority Electorate, which has been strongly Democratic.\n\nWith Blacks, they've constantly tried to paint the Democrats for pushing Real Racism because of their policies. They also tried to display Black Republican politicians and pundits to display how Conservatism resonated with them. But for the most part, it failed due to disparaging rhetoric pushed by some Republican politicians and pundits. And it definitely didn't help that some of the Black Conservatives engage in such rhetoric themselves without fail.\n\nRegarding Hispanics, they've received mixed results due to certain views like Religion (Catholicism), Family Values, Traditional Marriage, Anti-Abortion, Hard Work, etc. resonating with them in certain states particularly in the South like Texas and Florida. But due to Anti-Immigration sentiment (not just Illegal Immigration as they always claim to say, but Legal Immigration as well), they haven't won a large enough proportion.\n\nAs with Asians, they're politically irrelevant to them aside from their campaigns against Affirmative Action on College Applications, which ironically resulted in only fewer Asians being accepted so far in many Universities.\n\nIn terms of Religion, the GOP has constantly tried to court the Jewish community, especially in light of the Israel-Hamas War by painting themselves as pro-Israel and the Democrats as pro-Hamas.\n\nBut there's one religion that they always overlook let alone ignore and chastise completely and that is the Muslim community. But it wasn't always that way. They were once staunch Republican voters because like Hispanics, they agreed with most of the party's platform like Religion, Family Values, Traditional Marriage, Anti-Abortion, Hard Work, etc. An example would be their vote for George W. Bush for the Presidency in 2000 by 75%. But then 9/11, the failed wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and Anti-Muslim sentiment and legislation from the Republican Party such as concerns about so-called Sharia Law taking over the country alienated them resulting in a sharp turn towards the Democrats. But after more than 20 years, that relationship is undergoing another change due to President Joe Biden's slanted support for Israel during the Israel-Hamas War, especially since the community as a whole supports Palestine. Now, conflicted with a choice for who to vote for this year's candidacy especially since his successor Kamala Harris also stated that she's pro-Israel and the fact that Donald Trump is staunchly pro-Israel and has passed a sizable amount of anti-Muslim legislation during his first term as Presidency such as the infamous Travel Ban, they've decided to sit out, let alone vote for Third Parties such as Jill Stein of the Green Party.\n\nBut last week, something big happened. A Mayor from a Michigan city endorsed Donald Trump for the Presidency putting him and his hometown in the national spotlight. That person is Amer Ghalib. Originally from Yemen, he's the Mayor of Hamtramck, a city in the Metro Detroit area. Once a Polish enclave, it has since become predominantly Muslim. In 2015, it had a majority-Muslim council. In 2021, Ghalib became the city's first Muslim mayor. And in 2022, the council consisted entirely of Muslim men. In fact, it's one of two cities in Michigan that is predominantly Muslim with the other being Dearborn, which has been subject to lots of Right-Wing conspiracies for being a supposed no-go zone for Non-Muslims. Let's not forget that the state is home to one of the largest Muslim populations in the country, most of whom are Arab.\n\nThe city has garnered controversy in recent years as well. In 2023, Ghalib banned the display of LGBTQ flags on city property. During that same year, he failed to condemn a political appointee for making Antisemitic remarks. Earlier year, he and the city council voted unanimously to approve a legislation requiring the city to avoid investing in Israeli companies or those supporting Israeli Apartheid.\n\nNow, with this high-profile endorsement, he and the city are back in the spotlight for a completely different reason. Ghalib stated that he supported Trump during a campaign event in Flint stating that he's the right choice for this critical time as well as calling him a man of principles. He addressed his concerns towards him regarding a ceasefire in Gaza as well as concerns from both Arab and Yemeni communities. But the main reason for his support was because he saw no new wars during his Presidency.\n\nThat being said, there's a lot of potential into why the GOP should court Muslim voters even with an endorsement like this. In spite of the party's pro-Israel stance, the community shares a lot of social values with them, particularly family values, traditional marriage, anti-abortion, etc. But instead, they demonize and scapegoat them by stating that they supposedly want to take over the country and implement Sharia Law in spite of the fact that much of the platform is in line with it ironically. They also claim they don't assimilate even though they do by-and-large and were supposedly banned from immigrating to the US let alone running for office in 1952 when that isn't true. And last but not least, they accused former President Barack Obama for being a Muslim when he's actually a Christian. And let's not forget the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were deeply unpopular in the Muslim community as well.\n\nThis is why I say it's time the GOP reevaluate their stances on how they approach certain communities, including Muslims if they're really interested in winning this year's Presidential election. This way, they can ensure that these groups will be confident and not be ashamed knowing that the party they support is not exclusively or should I say mostly White and Christian/Evangelical as they're often accused of being.",

In the midwest, after these well-fed redneck people lost their car factory jobs because they were not competitive with foreign labor, they immediately get addicted to opiates and die en masse of \"deaths of despair.\"\n\nLikewise, homelessness is rampant in the US but the distinguishing thing about American poverty is that it's always associated with insanity and drug use. The poor in other countries live humbly and do what they can to make a living. In America, people literally go insane druggy mode the moment they fall on tough times. Keep in mind that being poor in America isn't even that bad. You get social services and pretty much no one starves to death outright unlike other places.",

        "selftext": "Israel was founded after the horrors of the Holocaust as a safe state for the Jewish people, in response to millenia of pogroms, genocides, persecution and violence.  2000 years of anti-Semitism culiminated in the Holocaust, in which 6 million innocent people were murdered simply for being Jewish.  Today the ar-b countries, along with the support of the genocidal regimes of iran, ruzzia and china are attempting to carry out the work that was unfinished in the Holocaust by trying to \"whipe Israel off the map\".  \n\nTherefore when we analyze the discourse (and disinformation) surrounding Israel's self-defense operations in the region, it's important to understand that much of the support for the \"palestinian\" is rooted in none other than centuries old anti-Semitism and a fundamental contempt and for the Jewish people. Anti-Semites see the Jewish Nation rebounding after 2,000 years of persecution, and they're mad.  Tis is the critical reality: the motivation behind their support for the so-called \"palestinians\" was NEVER about human rights but in reality about a desire see Israel, the Jewish state, weakened or delegitimized.  \n\nThis can very easily be explained by the fact that there are 126 majority xtian nations and 49 majority muslim nations yet only 1 Jewish nation, the Land of Israel.  Many majority xtian country's have worse human rights records than Israel, but these are hardly ever condemned.  Jewish Israelis never owned slaves, they never had Apartheid where they oppressed Black people, and they have one of the freest societies in the M.E. if not in the world.  Yet it is Israel which is condemned constantly.\n\nWhen we examine the history of how other came to be, NO country has the right to criticize Israel or the Jewish People. It is a fact that all sorts of justifications throughout history has been used to justify slaughter, torture and slavery, yet the Jewish People have never engaged in such things themselves. The average uninhibited, lunatic, who tries such a thing, gets labeled a person of interest by the local state. I don't know if that will happen in this case, but I do know that we have endured long enough their bold and frightening actions of Jew-haters. It's time to lose our patience and cool our kindness. It's time to ring the bells of truth. And it is absolutely right for Jewish people to stand up for themselves.\n\nThe end result of non-Jewish criticism of Israel is ultimately the delegitimization of the Jewish state itself.  This rhetoric often masks deeper hostility that can undermine the principles of human rights and the dignity of all people, including Jews. The Hamas government is recognized as a terrorist group.  They routinely violate the human rights against its own people. If anything, Israel is the liberator of the so-called \"Palestinians\" by removing Hamas from the equation.  If so, why aren't they being portrayed that way?  The lack of focus on these issues raises questions about the real motivations behind strong support for one side of the conflict. Was the goal really to promote human rights, or was it an expression of a deeper enthusiasm for the Jewish state?\n\nUnfortunately, anti-Semitism remains a widespread issue in the world. The attempts to make Israel a scapegoat in various geopolitical issues is simply an echo of age-old anti-Semitic herrings and harmful narratives about Jews. Such rhetoric is a form of stochastic terrorism - an attempt to incite hatred and violence against Jewish communities around the world. \n\nIn conclusion it is important to critically examine the motivations behind certain forms of support. When this support is linked to anti-Semitism or the desire to see Israel fail simply because it is a Jewish state, the supporters of a so-called \"palestinian\" state lose all credibility, and they should lose the support of any thinking, intelligent, human being as well.",

If we can set laws that clearly state a guide to how we engage with problematic behavior, then there will be less pressure to businesses/institutions to interpret the action themselves and divvy out inconsistent consequences. \n\nEssentially it is the government\u2019s responsibility to regulate and govern (for lack of a better word) the people.

As such taking an existing character and stripping them of their ethnicity and background for the sole purpose of avoiding a \"controversy\" is always wrong.",

        "selftext": "A lot of discussion on past events and history is being done through the lense of modern morality and norms. While I am not saying that it is completely impossible, or useless to discuss history from this point of view, I think it is unreasonable to use when trying to assign blame, or make sweeping conclusions about entire groups of people. \n\nThis issue is most prevalent, due to events we are all aware of, in discussion of Israeli/Palestinian conflict and it's history, however, I'll provide other examples as well. An appeal to morality and justice is often made, by both sides, when talking about the the emergence of the state of Israel.\n\nFor instance, pro Israelis will claim that various massacres and pogroms committed against the Yeshuv (the jewish population of Mandate Palestine) are abhorrent, inexcusable, and stem from nothing but hatred and antisemitism. This fails to acknowledge, however, that motivations of the Arab population were very different, informed less by antisemitic sentiment, and more by a general anti-western colonial drive, along with the built up frustrations of the last few decades. I think in the 1948 civil war between the Yeshuv and the Palestinians, the Arab side had their own, understandable and sympathetic motivation and justification, and I think the same of the Jewish side as well. \n\nOn the other side, pro-Palestinians will claim that partition plans and the forced exodus of Palestinians from the Mandate is immoral, and constitutes ethnic cleansing. It again applies the modern standards of population transfers to another time period. Today, we are in near uniform agreement that forced transfer of populations would be criminal. However, during the post WW1 and WW2 periods, those transfers were not viewed as uniformly immoral, as a reminder, the 1947 Partition Plan was suggested by the UN, and accepted by the majority of the states present. Taking territory through war is also seen as unacceptable today. However, up untill WW2 it was the status quo of the world.\n\nA similar situation arises when talking about slavery. While it is obviously important to recognize the practice for what it is, it is equally important to acknowledge that it was practiced by every major civilization on the planet, to the point where it can be considered a \"necessary\" part of civilization development through the ages. \n\nJust to elaborate, the fact I don't think modern morality is applicable to events and people's of the past, doesn't mean I consider them just, or moral. It simply means that when attempting to assign blame, understand motivations, and interpret actions, it must be done within the historical context of morality and status quo at the time. History is complicated as it is, and in order to actually learn something from it, we must learn to get into the mindset of people living in a world very different from our own. \n\nChange my mind.",

        "selftext": "I believe large-scale voter fraud via mail-in ballots is nearly impossible, and here's why:\n\n1. **In all states, mail-in ballots are voter-specific** and sent only to registered voters who haven\u2019t yet voted. For fraud to happen, a large number of these ballots would need to be intercepted before reaching their intended voters, and even then, these ballots must be filled out and mailed in fraudulently without detection.\n2. **Voters in every state can track their ballots** from the moment they are mailed out, allowing them to quickly recognize if their ballot has gone missing. If this occurred on a large scale, it would generate widespread complaints well before Election Day, exposing the fraud attempt.\n3. **The decentralized nature of U.S. elections adds complexity** to any fraudulent scheme. Each state (and often each county) has its own unique procedures, ballot designs, and security measures, making it nearly impossible to carry out fraud on a national scale.\n4. **All states\u2019 election laws mandate bipartisan representation** at all stages of the process, from poll stations to vote tabulation centers. There are no voting locations or counting centers staffed by just one party. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that partisan fraud could occur undetected.\n5. **Logistical hurdles make large-scale fraud impractical.** Coordinating such an effort would require an extensive network of co-conspirators, all risking serious legal consequences for an uncertain outcome. The personal gain (a win for a candidate) isn\u2019t worth the guaranteed jail time for those involved.\n\nNone of these points are my opinion - rather, they all represent the true nature of how mail-in voting works.  Additionally, each of the points outlined above intersect compliement and reinforce the others, creating a web of complexity that simply cannot be overcome in any meaningful way.\n\nChange my view.",

However, in the process it is getting progressively more and more geared towards war industry and upheld by government investments.\n\nThe Russian military budget exceeds 6% according to the SIPRI estimates. That is an enormous amount of money. Also, the Russian state dissolved a lot of its most available reserves into the war already.\n\nLet us imagine now that the fighting in Ukraine stops. Russian state can be hardly expected to dig up money to quickly convert the military industry into manufacturing cars or computers... Maybe this could be achieved with a massive foreign investment, but hardly anyone will be keen to invest in Putin's Russia as it is rather risky and Russian government would probably not be too happy about such resolution either. What will they do? They surely need to do something as millions will lose their jobs otherwise and the wheels will stop spinning.\n\nOne option would be to try exporting weapons. But it can't be expected that the Russian military industry will find many new customers for export, like it did with China and India in the past. Firstly, the performance of Russian weapon systems in Ukraine was hardly a successful PR event. Secondly, the relevant countries increasingly manufacture such systems themselves. Thirdly, Russia truly did become something of an unreliable pariah state and it can be reasonably expected that they will be avoided in the matters of national security.\n\nI personally believe that the easiest path for the Russian government would be to restart the war after a few years or to start a new one somewhere in the Central Asia/Caucasus/Baltics. This will again create demand for more and more weapons and the Russian state can continue without making significant changes.\n\nWith nationalism and imperialism on the rise in Russia, getting popular support for the new conflict doesn't have to be very difficult.

        "author": "LCDRformat",
        "selftext": "CMV: Male humans exhibit some behaviors and experience some emotions differently from females, and that is at least partially the result of natural biology or instincts.\n\nAbstract: I had a long argument with my girlfriend recently, and then also here on Reddit (You may check my comment history if you\u2019re really bored), about the predisposition of adult human males to prefer younger, healthy, reproductive aged females, sometimes inappropriately. I argued that this was a result of evolution selecting for men who were attracted to younger (But still reproductively healthy) females. I am aware that this is a dog whistle for pedophilia apologists. I don't like that, but I'm more concerned with if it's true than if it makes me feel good.\n\nAnyway, that specific proposition is not what I\u2019m addressing here, I\u2019m only bringing it up because I need to show that at least some people disagree with what I\u2019m saying:\u00a0\n\nMale humans exhibit some behaviors and experience some emotions differently from females, and that is at least partially the result of natural biology or instincts.\n\nThis argument on Reddit went where arguments on Reddit usually do (Hell), but with my girlfriend, the argument took an interesting turn: She asserted that males and females have no natural behavioral deviations, and that differences in behavior between men and women in the modern world is owed entirely to cultural influences. I brought up some of the following statistics that heavily favor male perpetrators:\n\n1. Sexual assaults\n2. Sexual harassment\n3. Violent crime\n\nI argued that this shows that men are naturally more prone to aggression and sexual violence (Especially since males represent like 90% of perpetrators in some of those categories). I agree that there is a misogynistic aspect of culture which often attempts to excuse how poorly men behave, and this can be conducive to worsening behavior (I am arguing that the violence and sexual aggression of modern men is some nature, some nurture).\u00a0\n\nShe argued that men and women are both equally predisposed to aggression and sexual violence from a natural standpoint, and that it is the culture in which we live that influences men to behave so much worse than females (She is arguing the aggression of modern men is entirely the fault of culture).\u00a0\n\nI also want clarify that I tend to slip and use 'man' in place of 'male' in some places. This argument doesn't account for trans people, and is meant to address the aggression and sexual violence of cismen.\n\n**My response:**\u00a0\n\nTwo main points I will be defending with regard to the natural status of men\u2019s aggression and sexual violence:\u00a0\n\n1. Testosterone causes aggression and libido increase\n2. Evolution selects for aggressive males and not as much for females\n\n**Point 1:**\u00a0\n\nIt is entirely true that testosterone is shown to increase libido and aggression.\u00a0\n\nLibido: [https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/andro.2021.0034](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/andro.2021.0034)\n\n\u201cA strong correlation between serum T levels and libido in men has been reliably and repeatedly demonstrated.\u201d\n\nAggression:\u00a0 fhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3693622/\n\n\u201cAtavistic residues of aggressive behavior prevailing in animal life, determined by testosterone, remain attenuated in man and suppressed through familial and social inhibitions.\u201d\n\nYes I simply googled for sources. I\u2019m not a scientist. I did skim both articles and they\u2019re certainly interesting reads if you have the time.\u00a0\n\nIt is also entirely true that men have, on average, significantly higher testosterone levels than women. Males average 300 to 900 nanograms per deciliter of in the blood, and females average 15 to 70 ng/dL. I don\u2019t gotta link that, we both know it.\n\nTestosterone causes increases in aggression and libido, and men have significantly higher rates of testosterone in their blood than women. This is correlation, but is it causation?\u00a0\n\nYes, and it\u2019s shown across the animal kingdom. According to this article:\n\n[https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2021/09/harvard-biologist-discusses-testosterones-role-in-society/](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2021/09/harvard-biologist-discusses-testosterones-role-in-society/)\n\n\u00a0which summarizes the work of Carole Hooven, a Harvard human evolutionary biologist, it does more than just correlate. Demonstrated in the animal kingdom: \u201cWhat is testosterone? It is evolution\u2019s tool to help male animals convert energy into offspring, which often requires aggression.\u201d\n\nIn the same article, the author discussed Hooven\u2019s response to an interesting criticism that is highly relevant:\u00a0\n\n\u201c... \\[Hooven\\] has come under fire from those who argue that behavior \u2014 including aggression \u2014 is largely learned, its roots being in culture, not biology. They say that emphasizing the role of biology in male aggression could play into the hands of those who believe acts such as attacks and rape should be viewed as less a matter of choice than part of a perpetrator\u2019s nature.\n\nHooven said the question is an important one and answered that critique by agreeing that culture has a profound effect on behavior.\u201d\u00a0\n\nI STRONGLY advise reading that whole article, as it addresses my opposition\u2019s point directly and more eloquently than I can. Hooven emphasizes that the behavior of men is to be EXPLAINED in part by their nature, ultimately testosterone levels, not EXCUSED.\u00a0\n\nThis was a criticism I came up against multiple times during my Reddit conversations and my argument with my girlfriend. I want to be very, very clear:\u00a0\n\nWhether or not something is natural has no bearing on whether or not it is moral or good. I am arguing that the aggression and sexual violence perpetrated more often by men can be explained both naturally and culturally. I am not arguing that we should excuse the behaviors of men who commit these crimes. I condemn all sexual violence and predation.\u00a0\n\n**Point 2.**\n\nHere I\u2019ll be appealing less to links and articles and more to intuition. I believe aggressive males would be naturally selected for by evolutionary processes.\u00a0\n\nExample I like to rely on:\u00a0\n\nSay you have a society with 50 men and 50 women. To protect and feed the society, you must engage in an act (War, hunting, exploration, you name it) that is guaranteed to destroy 30 people.\n\nIf you send only females to perform the act, the population in the society will be reduced to 50 males and 20 females. The maximum number of babies that the society can produce in the following year is 20.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0If you send a mix of men and women to perform this unfortunate but essential act, you will be depleting your population of males and females to 35 and 35. The maximum number of babies that can be born the following year would be 35.\u00a0\n\nIf you sent only males, your population would be reduced to 20 males and 50 females. The number of babies that can be born in the next year is 50.\u00a0\n\nIn other words, if the men are more aggressive and violent, and if the females are less so, the society is able to reproduce much more effectively and rebound population losses much more quickly. The females stay in the village while the males go stab each other with sharp sticks.\u00a0\n\nTo be clear on my opinion at this point, we are not an early hunter-gatherer society. Women do not need to be home, barefoot and pregnant. I am not JD Vance. I\u2019m arguing about how men evolved to be more aggressive, not proposing a social structure for our modern world.\u00a0\n\nAdding to this, the evolutionary advantages of male aggression are obvious in our closest cousins ( I recommend reading this whole article too, as it\u2019s interesting, and I\u2019m looking at buying the book is summarizes): [https://www.americanscientist.org/article/despicable-yes-but-not-inexplicabl](https://www.americanscientist.org/article/despicable-yes-but-not-inexplicable)e\n\nMy highly biased summary of the document is this: Aggressive males increase their chances of mating and reproducing. I would conclude from this that aggression in the males of our closest primate cousins is naturally selected for. Notably this includes micro-aggressions, so being a whiny, narcissistic asshole was probably evolutionarily advantageous at some point in our ancestral path, and still can be today, sadly.\u00a0\n\nPreempting some counter arguments:\n\n\u201cThis is an argument to excuse the sexual indecency of modern men by saying it\u2019s natural and they can\u2019t help it.\u201d\n\nNo, I am not excusing anything. I am explaining what I perceive to be the influence that our biological nature has over our behavior. Being horny and sexually assaulting someone is not excused by your biology any more than being angry and caving someone\u2019s skull in with a brick, or being hungry and stealing candy from kids. We\u2019re not dumb animals anymore, we can control our natural urges. Anyone who does not ought to be prosecuted fully.\u00a0\n\n\u201cTestosterone levels are not shown to increase male aggression over certain thresholds,\u201d\n\nThis is true, in certain common levels of blood testing, criminality and aggression in males shows no further correlation beyond a certain point. I would only point out that in the studies I linked above, Women are shown to increase in aggression and libido with higher testosterone levels, and up to a certain threshold, men are too. To appeal to anecdotes, we\u2019ve all heard of roid rage, and it\u2019s real. I recommend listening to Dr. Mike Isreatel on youtube, or anyone else is open about taking exogenous, (NSFW warning, he makes dirty jokes) androgenizing compounds, where he recounts his experiences on increases in rage, aggression, anxiety, and libido. Pretty much everyone familiar with the fitness industry will confirm it.\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t say that because our nearest cousins are a certain way, that means we are too,\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s true, more or less. I\u2019m appealing both to your intuition on this and the likelihood that our shared common ancestor, who we know very little about from 3 million + years ago, very likely shared the same behaviors I discussed. Thus, we would have inherited at least some of these traits, possibly (my new favorite word I learned from putting this together) Atavisticly exhibiting our ancestor\u2019s \u2018monkey brain\u2019 thining.\n\n\u201cThe reason men are more aggressive is because they\u2019re bigger and stronger, not because they have innate behavioral differences,\u201d\u00a0\n\nTo this I would say you have it perfectly backwards. Nature rewards males who are more aggressive (See the studies on our nearest cousins using sexual aggression to ensure mating and reproductive rights). Larger, more powerful males are rewarded more strongly for their aggression, thus passing on their genes more effectively (In nature, not modernity). Thus, males are bigger and stronger because they are aggressive, not vice-versa.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cMen are more violent and sexually aggressive than women, but that is because our culture encourages that behavior, not because of any biological factors.\u201d\u00a0\n\nTo this I would say that one, that\u2019s almost impossible to test for, because it would be extremely difficult to build a study that somehow accounts for cultural influences on behavior when studying this topic. Two, I would ask where do those cultural norms come from? I would argue that most of our old-fashioned and immoral cultural norms from today arose from contributing biological factors in the past (See harmful religious beliefs and superstitions). It\u2019s absurd to me today that those biological influences which built our societal maladaptations have somehow disappeared from the gene pool. I think this argument indirectly supports my point.\u00a0\n\n**What would change my mind?**\n\nTo restate the thesis: Male humans exhibit some behaviors and experience some emotions differently from females, and that is at least partially the result of natural biology or instincts. To change my mind:\u00a0\n\n1. You could show that testosterone does not increase either aggression or sexual desire in humans, OR (1a) show that the massive disparity between male and female testosterone actually does not play a role in male aggression at all.\u00a0\n2. Demonstrate that in our evolutionary history, males being more aggressive than females was either disadvantageous or eclipsed by the positives of less aggressive males.\n3. Show a modern study of human behaviors that accounts for cultural influences and neutralizes them, which demonstrates males and females have a similar baseline natural level of aggression. Emphasis \u201caccounts for cultural influences and neutralizes them,\u201d\n4. Show that men are actually about as aggressive as females. This one seems impossible given the spread of violent crime statistics which overwhelmingly implicate male criminality.\u00a0\n\n**Conclusion**\u00a0\n\nIn conclusion, we have very good reasons to think that males and females have at least some behavioral differences from birth. Our biology dictates at least some of our behavior, while some of our attitude and personality is influenced by the society and culture we live in as well.\u00a0\n\nI believe it is not the case that the differences in male and female aggression and sexual violence are a result of cultural influence alone.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m doing housework now and will respond to as much as I can before bedtime tonight. I want to restate that I do not condone sexual violence of any kind, and that excusing male aggression is not the purpose of my argument.\u00a0",

However, unresolved surveillance practices like FISA Section 702, which still permit broad surveillance of foreign targets and incidental collection of U.S. citizens' communications remain problematic.\n* A rebuttal to my position might bring up the concerns about America's international surveillance and personnel in the field, but holding Snowden responsible for the consequences is akin to blaming journalists for exposing government wrongdoing in war, even if their reporting indirectly affects military operations. Just as we wouldn't hold war correspondents accountable for the consequences of exposing atrocities, Snowden's actions aimed to hold the government accountable for unconstitutional surveillance, not harm personnel in the field.\n\nWhy he did it: Did he do it in such a way that represents adherence to a greater good and potential for self-sacrifice? \n\n* He sought to inform the American public. \n   * While this might be splitting hairs, it is important that we establish he did not do it to harm America relative to its enemies.\n      * Glenn Greenwald, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist who worked with Snowden, has affirmed that Snowden\u2019s intent was to inform, not harm.\n      * Snowden carefully selected documents to expose programs targeting U.S. citizens, avoiding releasing materials that could directly harm U.S. security operations abroad. He did not give information to hostile governments but to journalists, ensuring journalistic discretion in the release of sensitive data.\n* About programs he deemed to be violations of the 4th Amendment\n   * That these programs did indeed violate the 4th Amendment has been litigated and established. \n      * 2013: U.S. District Court Ruling In Klayman v. Obama (2013)\n      * 2015: Second Circuit Court of Appeals Ruling In ACLU v. Clapper (2015)\n      * 2020: Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Ruling In United States v. Moalin (2020), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit\n\nThe power of his antagonist(s): Who was the big boss? Was he punching down, or was he punching up? \n\n* On a scale of \"not powerful at all\" to \"as powerful as they get\": \n   * Snowden went up against the US gov't, its plethora of intelligence agencies and all their networks of influence, the DoJ, the entire executive branch... this has to be \"as powerful as they get\". \n   * In 2013, and somewhat to this day, the portrayal of Snowden is, at best, nuanced, and at worst, polarized. I'd frame this as \"almost as powerful as they get\". Even today, a comparison of Snowden's wiki vs. a comparative, Mark Felt, Snowden is framed much more controversially.  \n\nTL/DR: Edward Snowden should be categorized in the same light as Mark Felt (Deep Throat) and Daniel Ellsberg (Pentagon Papers). Edward Snowden exposed unconstitutional mass surveillance programs, violating the 4th Amendment. He leveraged his NSA admin rights to securely obtain and smuggle classified data. His intent was to inform, not harm the U.S., ensuring no sensitive information reached hostile governments. His actions led to significant reforms, including the curtailment of bulk phone record collection, though some programs like FISA Section 702 remain problematic. Snowden faced opposition from the most powerful entities in the U.S., including the government, intelligence agencies, and the executive branch\u2014making his fight one of \"punching up\" against the most powerful forces. Today, he remains a polarizing figure, though his actions, motivation, and accomplishments should make him a hero for exposing illegal government activities.\n\n\n\nEDIT: thank you everyone for your comments. My view has been improved based on some corrections and some context.\n\nA summary of my modified view:\n\nSnowden was right to expose the unconstitutional actions of the US govt. I am not swayed by arguments suggesting the 4th amendment infringement is not a big deal.\n\nWhile I am not certain, specific individuals from the intelligence community suggest they would be absolutely confident using the established whistleblower channels. I respect their perspective, and don't have that direct experience myself, so absent my own personal experience, I can grant a \"he should have done it differently.\"\n\nI do not believe Snowden was acting as a foreign agent at the time, nor that he did it for money.\n\nI do not believe Snowden \"fled to Russia\". However, him remaining there does raise necessary questions that, at best,  complicate, and at worse, corrupt, what might have originally been good intentions.\n\nI do not believe him to be a traitor.\n\nI am not swayed by arguments suggesting \"he played dirty\" or \"he should have faced justice\". \n\nThere are interesting questions about what constitutes a \"hero\", and whether / to what degree personal / moral shortcomings undermine a heroic act. Though interesting, my imperfect belief is that people can be heros and flawed simultaneously.\n\nOverall, perhaps I land somewhere around he is an \"anti-hero\"... He did what was necessary but didn't do it the way we wanted. \n\nAnd, as one commenter noted, the complexity of the entire situation and it's ongoing nature warrant an asterisk. \n\nI hope the conversation can continue. I've enjoyed it.\n",

        "selftext": "Road accidents are *one of* the leading cause of death in the US and many other countries (EDIT 6). Most people I know (including myself) vastly overestimate their driving ability, which makes them less risk-averse and more of a danger to themselves and others.\n\nMy core assumptions are:\n\n* **\"Driving IQ\" is normally distributed**, meaning that:\n   * Most drivers are average, and ~~half of all drivers are below average (shitty drivers)~~. see edit 1\n   * Most accidents are caused by the below average drivers.\n* **When confronted with a new situation, people revert to the mean**; You may be good at driving, but if a new situation or road condition occurs, you are usually just \"okay\" at handling it. Many things cause even the best drivers to revert to the mean or worse:\n   * Weather (ex. A patch of black ice makes it impossible to stop)\n   * Distractions (ex. Your bluetooth won't connect so you keep fiddling with your phone)\n   * Poor road design (ex. A stop sign is obscured by an overgrown bush, a neighborhood with pedestrians is designed with too-wide roads)\n   * Mood (ex. I know that I've been so hungry/angry/sad before I drove way over the speed limit)\n\nI have to constantly remind myself when I drive that I am at best a painfully average driver. I think that as people get more driving experience, they tend to become complacent and think that having 20 years of driving experience automatically makes your driving IQ really high. It doesn't, and assuming you're a good driver is actually irresponsible.\n\nChange my view :)\n\nEDIT 1: u/THE_CENTURION/ u/Livid_Lengthiness_69/ pointed out that I botched the interpretation of the normal distribution pretty badly. Better to say that \"most drivers are average\", i.e. most will fall within 1 standard deviation of mean driving skill. I'd then guess that the few crappy drivers have outsized risk and impact other drivers more. Really, this is more of a fuzzy analogy than a real attempt at a statistical model, but I at least want the analogy to be clear.\n\nEDIT 2: u/Caracalla81 pointed out this argument leans pretty heavily into the \"personal responsibility\" aspect of driving. I failed to consider that there are probably lots of people that suck at driving, and know they suck at driving, but they need to drive to live. In this case, my POV isn't helpful at all. The overall car centrism of many places forces these self aware bad drivers to drive.\n\nEDIT 3: u/yyzjertl pointed out that \"being bad at driving\" can stem from people just not caring, or being selfish (ex. speeding bc they want to get somewhere faster). They can be perfectly capable of driving really well, but just not give a shit. So it's not just a \"skill issue\", it can also be an issue of values. u/automaks added that the *driving* culture can also force people to act more selfishly out of pure pragmatism (ex. if you drive \"by the law\" in Delhi or Hanoi, you're probably not going to get where you want to go, even if you're being \"unsafe\" by some holier than thou standard).\n\nEDIT 4: u/FreeFortuna (by agreeing with me) made realize that \"Driving IQ\" is kind of a dumb metaphor, but it's the only way I could think to smash the idea of \"driving skill\" and the idea of \"normal distribution\" together, so that I could arrive at \"most people are average, don't get too confident\". It's an analogy, so take it with a grain of salt.\n\nEDIT 5: u/UnovaCBP pointed out that being really good at driving (ex. motorsports) is fundamentally the same skill as driving on the street. They drive very strategically and decisively. If someone on the road strategically ignores traffic laws (ex. \"*fuck it I'll go 15 over, I'm driving 800 miles on I-70 and everyone else is doing it. This will actually save a lot of time and if I see a cop on google maps I'll slow down*\"), it actually doesn't necessarily make them a bad driver and can be done safely (in theory). A bit of a chaotic good answer; There is a fine line between justified confidence and dangerous overconfidence.\n\nEDIT 6: u/cez801 fact checked me on the leading cause of death in the US. I more meant \"driving is the most dangerous thing most of us do on a daily basis\" and then botched the stat when I retrieved it from long-term memory :) They stated that while driving ability is\u00a0*one*\u00a0factor, it cannot adequately explain road death differences between the US and some other countries (ex. Norway), because it isn't reasonable that people in those other countries are somehow just way more self aware or way better at driving. So even if it is part of the equation its effect is **not significant**.\n\n* Also, u/hacksoncode reminded me that the \"normal distribution\" thing is more an analogy bc there is no way to *really* reduce this down to a single metric. If we wanted to make a better model, maybe I'd try something like a multiple regression model. Then we could look a metric like \"innate driving ability\" as just one factor among many that influence road safety. `accident_rate = \u03b2_0 + \u03b2_1*driving_ability + \u03b2_2*road_condition + \u03b2_3*traffic_density + \u03b2_4*road_design + etc.`This significantly complicates my view, but doesn't contradict it *assuming* the coefficient on driving ability is positive. But u/hacksoncode pointed out that even if the coefficient is positive, it doesn't necessarily make it significant! Also, it's probably better to look at how *outcomes* are distributed rather than skill. Outcomes are probably not normally distributed. I'm not a traffic modeler! Forgive me :)\n\nEDIT 7: u/awfulcrowded117 Said that \"most accidents are caused by temporary, almost inevitable lapses in concentration\", not a lack of ability. This is kind of what I meant when I mentioned mood (maybe that's cheating), but the analogy of IQ obviously isn't clear. Really, it's more \"how well you drive at any given moment\" if that could be smashed down into a single number, and allow regression to the mean. I maybe na\u00efvely think it is probably still normally distributed via the CLT, but I am just doing this for fun lol",

Secondhand smoking may lead them to develop some form of reactive airway disease, to struggle with chronic allergies, or even to have an increased risk of some form of cancers!

If you disagree, I'd love to hear why. Hopefully this post meets the rules.\n\n\n\nEdit 1: \n\nHi, everyone! This is a hot take that I didn't give enough examples for. My two examples were logical extremes that were purposefully brutal and only meant to illustrate REALLY destructive beliefs/scenarios that would obviously put relationships in hot water. My assertion was meant to imply that both people would be aware that what was communicated was simply what the person truly believed, independent of communication standards or social norms. I am genuinely sweating at the pressure this post has provided.\n\nTo those who imply I'm projecting, I have been through narcissistic abuse, and I've been around a lot of people who would rather abandon me than hear me tell even a VERY LOVING, KIND (subjectively) explanation of my beliefs. I recognize that the examples provided are VERY jerky and perhaps a little austic \ud83d\udc80 So, yes, that influenced my two examples, but they're by far the only situations that would destroy relationships.\n\nI honestly feel very misunderstood, and ironically I feel a little more convicted in my belief because people seem to be suggesting I'm a malicious monster or something. Believe it or not, I TRULY value kindness, consideration, understanding, and empathy, and that's why I felt called to post this. Many people have valued their worldview over my worth and my right to exist as a differentiated individual in this world to the point where I might as well be garbage if I express myself in a way that contradicts their view. \n\nThe replies to this post are getting very numerous, and I am not capable of replying to even half of them with the time and attention they deserve. Your opinions are valid,  regardless of any way they SEEM to conflict with mine. I believe two seemingly opposing opinions can be true at once. This comment section is getting a little too stressful for me, and I'm feeling overwhelming and kind of monstracized. I apologize if I upset anyone with my lack of explanation. I am not immune to being wrong. It is clear that so many of you value unconditional love, which warms me, and lightens the intensity of my belief in some ways \u2764\ufe0f I hope you don't think I'm a monster or a villain.\n\nEdit 2:\n\nBeing absolutely vulnerable here, I feel so rejected by this comment section \ud83d\ude29 I really feel like almost all of you think I'm this monster because of the examples I provided. I posted this because I wanted people to help me HEAL from the types of harsh criticism and demonization in my examples. I freaking love my friends and family! Just because I hold this view doesn't mean I'm evil or something! Do you see WHY I hold it? I express my GENUINE feelings and thoughts, and then I'm misunderstood and essentially rejected for it! I'm not justifying or moralizing ANYTHING here! I can't help that I believe this. Beliefs AREN'T A CHOICE. I want everyone to be happy and healthy and loving and in harmony, no matter what kind of person I sound like. Don't attack my character based on one post \ud83d\ude2d Like you don't even know me. I'm not TRYING to play victim here, but how else am I supposed to deconstruct a belief that others disagree with if I can't express it?!\n\n---\n\nI bit off more than I can chew, and I am not emotionally capable of engaging anymore.

        "title": "CMV: Society is moving towards everyone only using English and that is a good change",
        "author": "Mysterious-Law-60",
        "selftext": "I am not saying there are not advantages of having many languages and everyone having their own language. But the advantages of having a global language strongly outweigh the disadvantages. \n\nMy main points:\n\n- Language barriers are a major reason for disconnect in understanding people from different cultures and having a global language will help with communication across countries\n\n- English dominates the global scientific community, with approximately 98% of scientific papers published in English. English is the most used language on the internet, accounting for around 60% of all content. English is the official language of aviation as mandated by the International Civil Aviation Organization. And many more industries use English as the primary language. \n\n- A significant amount of resources are spent on understanding someone who speaks another language like translators, translating technology. Costing for translation technology was approximately 67billion USD per year in 2022(https://www.languagewire.com/en/blog/top-translation-companies) \n\n- Studies and data show that immigrants from countries like the U.S. and Canada are more likely to move to countries where the primary language is English, like UK, Australia. This is because integrating into a society where the same language is spoken is much easier. The same is true for travel as well.\n\n- I do think preserving culture is important but I disagree regarding the importance of language in culture. Culture is more about a shared group of beliefs, behavioral patterns. Language is a means to communicate and the majority of beliefs of a culture can remain the same even with something universally understood language like English. I am not saying it is not part of it, it is just a minor part and the cultural ideas can remain mostly the same even with a different language\n\n- Many individuals stick to people of their own culture because they feel more comfortable speaking the language they learned from when they were young, it is what they are used to. I don\u2019t think older people should but all the younger generation should learn it and then they will eventually move to learning just it. \n\n\n\nPersonal Story \n\nI am an individual from India where there are like 100+ languages. There is a language which is spoken by most Indians which is Hindi but every state has multiple different languages many of which are very different. Think about it like every US state has their own language. There are issues with the government proceedings, general communication between states because of the number of different languages. Most North Indian states speak Hindi and another local language and there is a relative connect with these states but South India, Hindi is not spoken but there are more English speakers. This creates a general divide between North and South India. This is just an example but there are many other situations where things like this are seen for example people from China are often friends with other Chinese people because they want to speak the language they are most used to. I personally would like for English to be the spoken language because it would make me understand them and people from other cultures much better and vice versa. The existence of a global language will help people from one culture understand people from another. There is a lot more understanding in the current world than in the past but realistically the level of understanding which will be achieved by the existence of a global language is much more than without and that level of understanding will help society move forward\n\n\n\nCommonly asked questions I expect\n\nWhy English? Why not Chinese or something else?\n\nEnglish is the official language in 59 countries and it has almost 2 billion speakers in some capacity. (https://www.dotefl.com/english-language-statistics/). According to some sources the numbers vary and say English has more speakers than Chinese, etc and I don\u2019t want to argue about that. I also do not have any particular personal interest in English. It is just the language I think which is best suited to being a global language because there is a lot of infrastructure(like English based educational systems, global businesses which operate primarily in English), countries which would support it\n\n\n\nThere are translation apps and translation technology. Why not just try to perfect it?\n\nThat is a possible route but translation technology is hard to develop to the level of convenience which would exist with having English as the language. Even Google translate usually makes a number of mistakes with understanding emotions in a language and if someone learns it from when they were young then they will know how to express their thoughts \n\nA translation tool would have to detect audio, understand a persons language, translate it, and say it out loud to the other user. This will not be perfected and even comparable to the level of communication which will be possible with 2 people knowing the same language.\n\n\n\nYou just want the globalization and americanization of every country and your ideals to be imposed on other and that will never happen\n\nI agree that every culture has their religious practices, their behavior, their beliefs and they should be respected. I don\u2019t want them to become stereotypical Americans but I think they should speak English because it will make communication between people of different cultures much much more. \n\n  \n\n\nWhat I want to know to Change my view: \n\nWhat are the advantages of a world with multiple languages Vs world with a global language?\n\nCompare these advantages of having English as a global language which I have stated.

        "selftext": "So I have heard that question \"if you flip a coin 999,999 times and each time it comes up heads is it more likely to come up tails the next time?\" The answer is of course no, it always has a 50/50 shot. I understand that mathematicaly, the coin doesn't \"know\" that it has come up heard the last few times so now it should come up tails. The previous flips do not affect the next flip. I understand that. \n\nHowever, imagine this: if you were to flip a coin 10 times, the chances of it landing on heads each time are pretty slim. The chances of it landing on heads 11 times is even less than being heads 10 times in a row. Then 12 times is even less likely than 11 times, and 13 times is even less likely than 12 times. So, if we look at each new number of flips as its own occurrence, we can see that it is less likely to land heads 12 times than 11 times, so it is MORE likely that the coin will land heads 11 times and tails 1 time than it is that it lands on heads 12 times. \n\nSince we have established that it is a FACT that it is more likely for the coin to be heads 11 times tails 1 time than heads 12 times, that means that if we flip a coin 12 times and KNOW that at least 11 of them will be heads, probability states that the other time is more likely to be tails. So why does this all crumble as soon as we leave the hypothetical and go into the reality of a coin flip?",

You make a choice, every time you open the app, to doom scroll. No one is forcing you to do that. \n\nTo be clear: I understand that it\u2019s an addiction of sorts, and the social pressure to remain active on the app is very strong. I\u2019m NOT saying we should levy the blame on the victims; just as we don\u2019t (at least, I don\u2019t\u2026 and I hope most people don\u2019t) demonize and shame and decry other victims of addiction \u2014 drug addicts, alcoholics, etc. \u2014 we shouldn\u2019t be doing that to these people, especially given that many of them are super young. (Although there is an argument to be made that these addictions are physical, whereas social media isn\u2019t, which means that discipline is more in play.) They need help. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily imply that the fault lies with the social media companies. We\u2019re not suing Absolut Vodka when someone gets so inebriated that they have a stroke. \n\nSome may invoke the Oxycontin scandal (good documentary on Netflix about that, by the way) to prove how companies sometimes can and should be held responsible; but that was because Purdue Pharma was deliberately and continually marketing their drug as completely safe and harmless even while knowing that it was anything but that. I don\u2019t think Instagram has ever perpetuated the narrative that their app is totally without risk. \n\nCMV. I\u2019m open to my mind being changed, especially because (ironically enough?) I hate social media, for the most part; so please don\u2019t construe me as some sort of terminally online apologist for it. But that doesn\u2019t mean I think we should be blaming it.

Why can you reject somebody based on race (physical traits) and it's perfectly ok but you can't refuse to do business with somebody based on this.\n3.  In a free market, discriminatory practices would likely lead to negative consequences for the business, such as loss of customers or reputation. Other businesses can avoid it by not having any preference who to serve. This natural mechanism could discourage unfair treatment more effectively than laws, while still keeping individual freedom of business owners. \n4. Why businesses are allowed to refuse service based on dress codes? Race for example, is also a visible characteristic, so why is it treated differently?\n5.

The rich are not good for an anabolic diet, eating them is the equivalent of eating a box of oreos, you will not feel as full afterwords, so you will have to eat more and more rich people, and eating more people is more morally wrong than eating less people (This is basic common sense).\n\nSecond, they might have caused the famine in the first place, so they may have special information or may even know of some hidden away food stores.

        "author": "ReportedGlittering",
        "selftext": "There are new allegations popping up against Mrbeast daily, and while some of them are true, most of them are just that, allegations. I won\u2019t be using any non related content as \u201cevidence\u201d for this post, since it\u2018s more important to focus on the actual allegations rather than whether or not Dogpack404 uses shrooms.\n\n1. PDF Claims\nThis claim consists of two parts: The Discord server and the \u201cart\u201d. Let me be clear; Chris Tyson is a COMPLETE creep, although for the sake of the length of this reddit post I won\u2019t be explaining why. Yes, Mrbeast was confirmed to be in Chris\u2019s discord server. Chris Tyson talked to minors inappropriately on the server, but did MrBeast do so? No. Being in a discord server where someone was talking inappropriately to minors, DOES NOT mean that you are a PDF file, OR that you were aware of it. What did Mrbeast say on the server that made people go crazy and accuse him of PDFelia? \u201dChris has a big pp\u201d. Yeah I ain\u2019t using that as evidence\u2026 He was by no means active on the server, as claimed by quite a few smaller creators, but infact, this was one of the only messages he ever sent. \n\n2. \u201eJimmy knew\u201c\nChris had hung a picture of on a wall showing a girl pointing a gun in her mouth. The picture was drawn by Shadman who is known to create CP content. In this case Jimmy was not the only person in the room, as quite literally the entire Mrbeast crew was inside the room. As said by someone else 2 months ago: \u201ecan't blame jimmy.. the image in question doesn't look underage, and i don't think that jimmy would know who shadman is, or his artstyle. hell he probably thought it was just a poster of an anime babe, and so did the other guys in the room.\u201c. It is as simple as that.\n\n3. Illegal lottery allegations\nDid Mrbeast host \u201eillegal lotteries\u201c? The short answer is: Yes. The reason behind how it happened is way more interesting. Captain Sparklez talked about it in his video and I recommend you go watch it if you already haven\u2018t. To put it shortly: An illegal lottery is something that requires payment or substantial effort, and gives you a chance to win a prize. By definition, quite literally even Willy Wonka has hosted an illegal lottery when he sold chocolate bars that had a chance to contain a ticket to the chocolate factory. Mrbeast, like Captain Sparklez, is just one of the countless Youtubers who have accidentally hosted an illegal lottery, and while it happened, it\u2018s almost certain that it was by accident.\n\n4. Faking Charity\nMrbeast was accused of faking building 100 wells in Africa, simply because he didn\u2018t include a picture of every. single. well. in his video. This is amongst one of the stupidest \u201eallegations\u201c that I have ever heard of, yet due to all of the other allegations it has been taken seriously. He most likely just didn\u2018t have pictures from each well. 100 wells is a LOT, and he couldn\u2019t have been there for each one of those to ensure that it was taken a picture of.\n\n5. Including people that he knew in his videos\nThis allegation has already been addressed. A Mrbeast\u2018s friends were called on set to fill in for those who couldn\u2019t make it or got tested positive for Covid. This way he could host \u201e100 Boys vs 100 Girls\u201c instead of hosting \u201e96 Boys vs 98 Girls\u201c.\n\n6. Faking videos\nSome of Mrbeast\u2019s videos are at least partly faked. An example of this was when Logan Paul was edited to place 3rd place in Creator Games 3, when in reality he placed 4th. If I had to guess this was likely done to make the video perform better. He has most definitely partially faked some other videos, or edited them to make them seem different, but the main point is that if you win, you always get the money promised. \n\n7. Mrbeast\u2018s *Fake* Signatures\nThis is one of the bigger allegations that have been used against Jimmy. Jimmy specifically stated multiple times in the livestream that only one of the crew members would be signing each shirt. Tyler signed his own signature, \u201eTC\u201c as well as \u201eMB\u201c to show that it was signed by a Mrbeast crew member. \u201eMB\u201c is NOT Jimmy\u2019s signature (\u201eJD\u201c is), but rather an indicator of the Mrbeast crew. \n\n8. Mrbeast Lawsuit\nFor those of you who didn\u2018t know, Jimmy got together over 1000 contestants to compete for a prize of $5,000,000. The show was \u201cunfortunately complicated by the CrowdStrike incident, extreme weather and other unexpected logistical and communications issues\u201d, as stated by a Mrbeast employee. To put it simply, Mrbeast hosted something that was too big for him. 1000 contestants is a LOT, and Jimmy clearly wasn\u2018t ready for that. \n\n9. Dogpack\u2019s third video\nThis video didn\u2018t contain anything of worth. I won\u2019t cover all of it individually, as the video itself was confirmed to be based on purely false information, even admitted by Dogpack himself. I do not see the point of still having this video on Youtube, as it is based purely on false allegations. If I would address every single claim that was made in this video individually, I\u2018d have to at least add another 5 sections to this reddit post. Jimmy\u2018s CEO, objectification of women at work etc\u2026 All of those were false.\n\n10. Contestant \u201eTortured\u201c on Mrbeast\u2018s video\nJake Weddle was a contestant in one of Mrbeast\u2019s videos. He was in a poor mental state during the recording of one of Mrbeast\u2019s videos. He asked to have the lights turned off, but was refused as it was apparently a part of the challenge. He made it to day 11/30 and was paid $110,000 as a result of lasting 11 days. Mrbeast had not been aware of the contestants mental state during the recording of the video. Jake Weddel talked about it on Dogpacks video, saying that he would want to be paid the entire $300,000 instead of just the $110,000. Mrbeast realized that Jake had not been in a clear mental state during the filming of the video, and how much that had affected him, which is why he offered to pay him the rest of the $190,000 off-camera. \n\n11. Mrbeast including a registered s3x offender in his video\nUnless I am completely wrong, this was confirmed to be true. It was his mistake. He should be enforcing stricter background checks on the people that he includes in his videos.\n\nIt\u2018s very hard to try to prove some of the allegations as fake, when the allegation itself doesn\u2018t have any evidence of being real in the first place. Before anyone comments on it: Yes, I did watch Dogpack\u2018s videos. If I missed something, or unknowingly used any false information let me know. My point is NOT that Mrbeast has never done anything bad in his life; We all have. But rather my point is that he is getting way more heat from the media than he deserves. Keep in mind that all of these allegations allegedly happened in the span of multiple years. Everyone makes mistakes, but I\u2018m open to change my view if someone has a good argument to be made.",

        "author": "BluePillUprising",
        "selftext": "I\u2019m a bit of a free speech purist. I don\u2019t want to get lost in the weeds of that for the purposes of this post, but to put it in a nutshell (and there is more nuance to this than I\u2019m getting into here), I believe that as long as your words are not being used to physically harm someone or defraud others, they should be allowed\u2014not only by governments, but by businesses and higher educational institutions as well.\n\n\nWhenever I make this argument, however, someone inevitably says, \u201cWell, what about Nazis? Do you support their right to free speech too?\u201d\n\nAnother thing I hear a lot is people who compare Trump to Hitler or the Proud Boys to the Brownshirts, or, on the right, people will compare abortion to the Holocaust or Reddit mods to the Gestapo. \n\nAll of this is disingenuous and it\u2019s done because people don\u2019t want to engage with ideas that are uncomfortable for them. It\u2019s not just lazy, however, it\u2019s also really offensive to the people who were actual victims of the Nazis. \n\nI think it bears pointing out what the actual Nazis did. They invaded all of their neighbors, imposed a brutal occupation, and systematically exterminated people they deemed to be subhuman\u2014horrific, ghastly crimes.\n\nMy view is that we should not invoke their memory when discussing modern politics for this reason. Let me explain in more detail. \n\n\n\n**1. Nazis Don\u2019t Really Exist Anymore**\n\nThe Nazis existed at a specific time in a specific place. The conditions that led to their rise (a rising power facing a humiliating loss after a bitter world war) were very particular. I understand that there are people who openly espouse Nazism today, but they are marginal in the extreme. Moreover, the few Nazis that do exist don\u2019t even really understand what they\u2019re talking about. And that\u2019s because\u2026\n\n\n\n**2. Nazism Was About Aggression Against Other Countries**\n\nThe alpha and omega of Hitler\u2019s ideology was the notion that the Germans deserved a *Lebensraum* that would come at the expense of Slavs in the east.\n\nWithout this, you don\u2019t really have Nazism. And if Hitler had not embarked on wars of conquest, there would have been no Holocaust, as the vast majority of the victims of the Holocaust were killed in countries that Germany invaded. Hitler, without WWII, becomes Franco\u2014not a good guy for sure, but not a name synonymous with genocide.\n\nThis is why it\u2019s ridiculous to compare MAGA, the AfD in Germany, or Le Pen in France or any of the modern far right movements in the west to Nazis. \n\nTo be clear, these groups are bigoted and deserve condemnation, but none of them are calling for the invasion of their neighbors. In fact, for the most part, they\u2019re calling for the opposite\u2014for their native lands to disengage from the world stage. \n\nAgain, that\u2019s not to say they\u2019re good, just that it\u2019s absurd to compare them to Nazis since they do not espouse an aggressive foreign policy which is what Naziism was all about and which is what made it such a horrific ideology.\n\n\n\nIt would be much more effective and intellectually honest and less offensive to the people who suffered the horrific acts of the Nazi regime, if we could simply discredit the modern far right without bringing Hitler into the discussion. \n\n\n\nHowever\u2026some countries in the world have invaded their neighbors, right? So\u2026\n\n**3. But What About Countries that Do Have Aggressive Foreign Policies?**\n\nHere\u2019s a fun riddle: What does Russia have in common with Ukraine, and what do the leaders of Israel have in common with Hamas?\n\nAnswer: All of them get compared to Nazis!\n\nI\u2019ll explain why this is ludicrous, one by one:\n\n\n\n**a. Russia:** Putin meets many of the \u201cmodern Hitler\u201d criteria. He\u2019s an authoritarian leader who invades his neighbors, right? Quacking like the proverbial duck. However, there are two points to make here.\n\nFirst, I don\u2019t think he wants to genocide the population of Ukraine out of existence and replace them with Russian settlers (which is what Hitler wanted to do only with Germans). What he wants is for Ukraine to bend the knee and become loyal subjects once again. And that\u2019s not OK! But it\u2019s also not Nazism.\n\nSecond, his army sucks. If Hitler\u2019s army had been like Putin\u2019s, WWII wouldn\u2019t have happened. After 2.5 years of fighting, they haven\u2019t been able to take one major Ukrainian city, something the Wehrmacht did within hours of invading Soviet Ukraine. Ability matters. \n\n\n\n**b. Ukraine:** What\u2019s funny is that Putin claims the reason he invaded Ukraine was to rid it of Nazism. What\u2019s even funnier is that there are actually streets and monuments in Ukraine dedicated to Stepan Bandera and the Ukrainian Partisan Army, who did temporarily cooperate with the real Nazis during WWII (before they started fighting them) and who were absolutely violent far-right antisemites. However\u2026\n\nUkraine is currently led by a Jewish person and is the victim of an invasion by their neighbors, not the perpetrator of aggressive wars so\u2026 no, not Nazis.\n\n\n\n**c. Israel:** OK, let\u2019s get the obvious out of the way up front. Israel is a Jewish state. How could it be Nazi?\n\n Well, yeah, but the whole idea of Israel is a bit *Lebensraum*-y, and they do invade their neighbors and have killed thousands of innocent Palestinians, so\u2026 could they be just a little bit Nazi?\n\nNo. Because clearly, they are not fighting and killing at full force. If Israel were run by a Hitler, the area around Israel would be a howling wasteland and the Palestinians would have ceased to exist around 1948. \n\nSorry, I\u2019m not a big supporter of Israel, but I can\u2019t say they deserve to be compared to Nazis.\n\n\n\n**d. Hamas:** Here is a group that meets a lot of Nazi criteria. Antisemitic? Check. Genocidal? Check. Capable of inflicting devastating violence and occupation on its neighbors?\n\nNope. Hamas has no real weapons, no navy, no air force, no tank divisions. Maybe they\u2019d like to be as scary as Hitler, but they just aren\u2019t. In fact, they\u2019re really just pathetic and weak which is the opposite of what the Nazis were. \n\n\n\nAt the end of the day, calling someone or some country a \"Nazi\" is just a scare tactic. It\u2019s used to rile people up and make them immediately hate the person or group being labeled. When we use the word \u201cNazi\u201d today, it\u2019s usually just a way to shut down any real conversation about the issues at hand. It\u2019s all about finding a way to not have a conversation. \n\nAnd that is lazy. There are plenty of arguments one can make in favor of a liberal immigration policy or women\u2019s reproductive rights, or police reform without resorting to labeling your opponents, \u201cNazis\u201d\n\nOr maybe I\u2019m wrong. Is there a reason to invoke the memory of the Nazis when discussing modern politics? Am I missing something? Can you change my view?",

But I believe this is a new derogatory word.\n\nThe definition of derogatory is \u201cshowing a critical or disrespectful attitude\u201d and that is most definitely what the effect of that word.\n\nMansplaining according to a Google search is \u201cis a colloquial expression used to describe situations in which a man provides a condescending explanation of something to someone who already understands it\u201d\n\nIf that was the strict the strict usage case, it wouldn\u2019t be that big of an issue. Yet I, as a man, feel like I cannot explain something without falling into the risk of being accused of mansplaining by someone.\n\nBecause mansplaining is now used whenever a man is explaining anything, ever - or at least in my experience.

That\u2019s what makes it derogatory - any word that is applicable to exclusively a particular demographic is derogatory and this is no different.\n\nTLDR the term mansplaining is no longer used to describe a man providing a CONDESCENDING explanation to someone who already understand it. It\u2019s now used to denigrate men that explain in any situation. It\u2019s used as a useful adjective to assign to a man someone doesn\u2019t like, since the situations I mentioned above are far from being exclusively male.",

I've heard pro-Israel people claim that the Gazans are the colonizers while I've also heard pro-Gaza people claim that the Israelis are the colonizers.\n\nWell, contrary to the popular belief amongst many pro-Gaza people, a lot of Israelis have darker skin than is usually thought of. It is true, however, that the Israelis are more likely to be Caucasians than the Gazans. But still, if you look at street interviews of both Israelis and Gazans, you can see how similar they can often look except for the fact that Gazans, being mostly Muslim, are more likely to wear religious headwear. You may be a lot more likely to find a White person in Israeli street interviews than in Gazan street interviews, but it's still not White people vs Brown people unlike the popular narrative amongst many Leftwing activists. The conflict has nothing at all to do with skin color.\n\nIt is true that on average Israelis have more Caucasian genes than the Gazans, but still Jew =/= Caucasian. It can be the case, whether it's a Jew in America or in Israel, but in many cases in Israel it's not the case. According to statistics, only 30% of Israeli Jews are descended from European Jews. A lot of them are of the same genetic background as the Arabs.\n\nHowever, with that being said, I don't think that it means that Israel's actions are justified. Because the Gazans have many of the same genetic background according to different studies, they should be treated as indigenous to the land as well. I am not pro-Israel by any means. But I am mostly talking about how the Jews are indigenous because it seems to me as though the pro-Palestine side is the one more likely to call Jews non-indigenous than the pro-Israel side is to call Arabs non-indigenous.",

        "selftext": "Of all the points that were made in the VP debate, my view is the one that Democrats would find the most progress (in voter persuasion and motivation) in amplifying would be Vance's remark in 2020 (but before covid) that \"Trump thoroughly failed to deliver\" on his economic promises.    \n  \nVance at the debate reinforced his reputation that he's at least relatively intelligent.  Even those who don't like him would acknowledge that.  The revelation that Vance had evaluated Trump in Feb 2020 to have \"thoroughly failed\" on his economic promises is a bombshell that I previously was not aware of because I had not read the Washington Post article revealing it.    \n  \nI feel like Democrats should be having a field day with this revelation:  1) The economy's the most important issue to voters. 2) Trump when he's campaigning tends to promise a utopia, so it's generally favorable to remind voters of his broken promises (even those not specific to the economy).  3) Vance's evaluation of Trump on the economy will be given credibility because he seems intelligent and he is right-wing.  4) Vance's remark is, in a humorous way, uncomfortable to both people on the Trump-Vance ticket, so it has the chance to be memorable.    \n\nInstead, most Democrats seem to want to amplify Vance's refusal to acknowledge Trump lost in 2020.  I don't think this is a very compelling point for several reasons:  1) Voters seem to care more about the economy than they do about political ideals like \"democracy.\" 2) Voters who are concerned that another January 6th might happen if Harris wins would obviously not be motivated to vote for Harris for this reason (they may be motivated to vote for Harris for other reasons but not to prevent a Jan 6th). 3) Those voters who feel most strongly that Trump lost in 2020 pay more attention to politics, and these voters are typically less up for grabs.  \n\nDemocrats complain that even though the economy's better under Democrats, Republicans have a better reputation on the economy, and they often lament that this indicates \"facts don't matter\" to voters.  Yet they miss golden opportunities like this to offer voters effective heuristics that allow them to conclude their choice will be better on the economy.  CMV.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

From washing machines and dishwashers to birth control. We have used technology to mitigate outcomes associated with differences in biological sex. As a result women are more able to participate in the work force and their careers.\n\nIn terms of gender roles, men haven't benefited to the same degree as women(as men weren't oppressed as a group, this is obvious). One major advantage that women have over men is that women have certainty about their parenthood of children. Maybe they don't know who the father is, but they know, outside of edge cases, that they are the mother. In order to mitigate this AND to destigmatize it, paternity tests should be the norm for newborns. \n\nThe destigmatizing point is just because requests for paternity tests frequently result in relationships ending.\n\nEdit: I've had my view changed at multiple points and won't be responding to further comments.",

Most undocumented workers have no money or assets and struggle to get by and the thought that they are competing with Americans in the housing market is just an outright lie from Vance. I struggle to see how that makes logical sense. If anything illegal immigrants make 20-30 percent of the construction workforce here in America and deporting them would only lead to a more catastrophic housing situation. Vance literally blamed undocumented immigrants for the housing issue in the debate which makes absolutely no sense and then also tried to say fentanyl was a main issue. Drug abuse will always be among us, fentanyl can be made anywhere. It is not like opium or cocaine unto which it requires acres of land and a plant. Tightening the border to help fight fentanyl is well intentioned but literally wont move the needle at all. Well guess what, if you make the #1 thing most Americans consider to be a part of the \"american dream\" even less affordable (housing) by deporting the very people who build the homes what do you think that does to the average American's state of mind? Financial reasons are a main contributing factor to addiction and drug abuse not the only but a huge factor.",

It's just significantly easier to find good, accurate, up-to-date documentation for Maven.  Plugins typically have more and better documentation for their Maven version than their Gradle counterpart.  Documentation and guides you find online hardly ever tell you to use deprecated features of Maven, and if they do, you can find easy to understand upgrade guides.  With Gradle on the other hand, you'll find a guide from a couple of months ago and the features they use are already marked as deprecated without any clear way to upgrade.

        "title": "CMV: Love is Inherently Conditional",
        "author": "Food_Luver",
        "selftext": "We often hear about *unconditional love*, but the more I think about it, the more it seems that love is always tied to certain conditions, whether we acknowledge them or not. We love someone or something because they meet certain conditions or criteria that trigger that love. For example, a child loves their parents because they're the ones who gave birth to them and raised them. Many people love dogs because they\u2019re cute, loyal, and fun to be around. If these conditions didn\u2019t exist\u2014if a parent was abusive or a dog was aggressive\u2014would the love still be there?\n\nThe same applies to romantic relationships. People fall in love with each other based on qualities like kindness, intelligence, or a shared sense of humor. If those qualities were to disappear, or if one person violated important values in the relationship (like trust or respect), wouldn't that love be challenged, if not entirely lost?\n\nI find this especially true in the context of religion. Many people talk about God\u2019s *unconditional love*, yet religious texts often show examples where love seems conditional. In the Bible, God punishes or kills those who disobey or sin. Even today, many believe that if you don\u2019t follow certain rules or accept certain beliefs, you will be condemned to hell. This seems like the ultimate conditional relationship\u2014if you don't meet specific criteria (faith, obedience), you lose love and face eternal punishment.\n\nTo clarify, I\u2019m not saying that the *concept* of unconditional love is entirely non-existent. But when you closely examine why we love or why others love us, it seems like conditions are always present.\n\nAlso, here are some of my thoughts about some potential counter-arguments:\n\n* Some might say that a parent\u2019s love for their child is a perfect example of unconditional love. However, I\u2019d argue that even this love has conditions. While most parents might love their child regardless of mistakes, extreme situations like a child committing heinous crimes could cause a parent to question or withdraw their love. Isn\u2019t that a condition\u2014where certain extreme actions could sever the emotional bond?\n* Some might also argue that God\u2019s love is unconditional, and it\u2019s human choice (through free will) that leads to punishment. But even then, it seems the love is conditional on obedience or faith. If one doesn\u2019t meet the condition of belief or moral behavior, the consequence is eternal damnation, which feels like a form of love withdrawal based on failure to meet certain conditions.\n* Another argument I see being made is that setting boundaries in relationships doesn\u2019t make love conditional. But boundaries are still conditions, right? If someone continually violates the boundaries we set, like trust or respect, we often stop loving them. Does that not make love reliant on meeting those conditions?\n\nI'd love to hear perspectives that might change my view. If you believe in unconditional love, what would be an example that truly fits that description? How do you reconcile conditional elements that might be present in even the most loving relationships?",

It's important for what I say below.\n\nI follow the Hitchens school of thought and believe that Islamophobia is a word created by fascists and used by cowards to manipulate morons.\n\nLately, I've been reading about the claims of antisemitism and I see similarities and ridiculousness of the usage of the label to shut down basic observations.\n\nI grew up in Mumbai around Parsis and equates jews basically to Parsis. To put into context my point, Parsis are an incredibly successful community and a minority in India. They have business tycoons and some of the richest people in India are Parsis and i attribute that to their closed knit community behaviour and their culture that promotes education. They are centered mostly in the cities like Mumbai.\n\nHaving observed them by living alongside them, i have seen all the good as well as the bad that comes with an in group tribe because it essentially functions as one. for example, the Tata group's former Chairman Ratan Tata wanted to step down, his pick for his successor was another Parsi, Cyrus Mistry even though Tata group doesn't lack competent people. To suggest that Parsis hold an outstretched influence in India compared to their population size is an understatement.\n\nin that similar vein, I see the claims of Jews in Hollywood, Banking, Media and politics. They do have an outstretched influence in these key fields and to deny that is basically denying common sense. All these avenues are where power is concentrated in modern societal structures and to suggest that people try to protect their own using this power is not an outlandish claim.\n\nas examples, Marc Rich is one name i came across. A Jewish man who happens to be on a top 10 fugitive list of the FBI for years resided in Switzerland freely for many years before he was pardoned by Bill Clinton hours before leaving office. The allegations of Jewish groups trying to protect him, including former minister in Israel and ADL chief. \n\nanother example I came across was when Nick Cannon was getting cancelled for making derogatory remarks about both white people and about Jewish people. But when it came to making an 'apology', the apology was made only to Jewish people even though things that he said about white people were far more dehumanising. It's not that difficult to understand why it was done.\n\nInfluence and control is power and groups, just like individuals can and often do weild that power to protect their own and consolidate more of it.\n\nso how is calling out that power structure and outstretched influence a minority have suddenly becomes antisemitism but it's not when applied to other groups.\n\nIf I said that \"Indians run the silicon valley\" because they do have an outstretched influence in the tech sector, I don't expect a backlash because there is a lot of truth in the statement. \n\nI mean I can understand that yes Holocaust happened but how does that change the basic observation that there's an outstretched influence that jews have in key areas.",

A great number of ignoramuses on Reddit will tell you these drugs are totally gonna have crippling side effects just wait a few years bro, but this is very unlikely and not relevant to my point.

It seems to me that the morbidly obese 60 year old who dies suddenly from a heart attack or stroke brought on by atherosclerosis costs the healthcare system much **much** less than the healthy, fit 90 year old who develops pancreatic cancer due to excess entropy brought on by living a very long time (his good health makes him love life so he wants to keep living as long as possible which will require obscenely expensive immunotherapy, chemotherapy and surgery). Our two greatest killers are heart disease and cancer. Cancer is most certainly more expensive because it's actually like a million different diseases in a trench coat, each with its own specialty treatments. This development will definitely shift the balance away from heart disease and toward cancer because cancer is practically inevitable if you live long enough.\n\nAnd that's to say nothing of the general trend of the elderly using vastly more healthcare resources than any other demographic as they are more prone to practically **all** diseases and reduced obesity simply allowing people to live longer.\n\nPlease prove me wrong because I don't want this to be true.

        "author": "Shak3Zul4",
        "selftext": "I often see people complain about 'pretty privilege'' and how it's unfair that people who are more attractive often are more likely to have more career advancement in their jobs. But to me it makes sense and I don't think it's unfair for a few reasons:\n\n1. **Image is a part of the job.** Yes knowing your job is a major part of the job but I've never worked a single job where image wasn't also a part of it. One of my very first jobs, I worked in a restaurant and despite the cooks having the aprons which are meant to catch any food splatters from getting on their main uniform, they were also expected to constantly change whenever it did get slightly dirty (which was rarely). They were supposed to come in well shaven, clean haircut, not smelling like smoke, etc. I've worked many jobs some dirty, some clean but in every single one there was an expectation to maintain a good image and this goes into my second reason\n\n2. **It shows effort/pride.** If you think about the difference between a job you take until you find something better and compare that to a job you want to advance in you're likely going to act differently. If you're a minimum wage worker at McDonalds just making some extra money, you're probably going to take 10 minutes to throw on your uniform, maybe brush your teeth and head to work. By contrast, if you're a employee at whatever job you're passionate about, you're probably going to take more time getting ready- taking a shower, brushing your teeth, shaving, maybe throwing on some cologne. The difference between those 2 preparations is for the latter, you're taking pride in your job and putting effort into your self and people notice that.\n\n  \n3. **The traits of a leader and the traits of an attractive person are often the same.** When looking at the the traits people find attractive and the traits of a leader you're going to see a heavy overlap. They're going to be more confident, more assertive, more charming, etc All these things are what people are looking for in a leader. Meanwhile a less attractive person may be lacking these traits. \n\n  \n4. **The false assumption that attractive correlates with less competent.** A lot of the 'unfairness' claims seem to stem from the idea that the ONLY reason this person was promoted/given a raise is because they're attractive, as if it's impossible for someone to be both attractive and competent at their job. Chances are the person is just as competent at their job if nor more so than a less attractive person. While I'm sure it's happened before, more often than not the person being promoted is competent AND attractive.\n\n5. **Anyone can be more attractive.** Very rarely are people naturally attractive. Even looking at supermodels and celebrities they have to work vigorously to maintain their image. If they ate junk food, lazed around all day, didn't go to the gym, and have a good skin care routine they're probably look pretty bad too. Obviously the average person can't afford the product or a personal assistant to help with these thing but you're also not expected to look THAT good. Going back to number 3 people can also work on their personalities and how they carry themselves because body language and self esteem is a major play in being found attractive. I'm sure we've all had a moment where we see someone who we don't initially find attractive but then once we see their personality our opinion shifts.\n\nSo yeah I don't think it's a problem that people who are more attractive also also get better opportunities and career advancement. To me when people complain about feeling like they weren't hired or promoted because they didn't wear make up or get a haircut or something, what I hear is \"I didn't want to put more effort into this aspect of my job, and someone else did and got promoted over me so it's unfair\"\n\n  \nWould love to hear other thoughts on this that might change my view",

        "selftext": "A rundown for those unfamiliar with a relatively obscure conflict. During the breakup of Yugoslavia, the republics of which it was made up started to secede in a series of bloody conflicts featuring ethnic cleansing and genocide. Note that there was a legal precedent within Yugoslavia's laws for this secession, decided by referendums.\n\nKosovo was an autonomous region carved out of Serbia, and has historically been Serbian, however it featured an ethnic majority of Albanians. The wars spurred a nationalist movement within Albanians who sought their own independence.  These ethnic irredentists began attacking serbian policemen and civilians which kicked off the Kosovo war. Serbia was brutal in its crackdown and it looked like a repeat of the carnage from the Bosnian war was imminent.  Later during the war, NATO intervened on the side of Kosovo and bombed what was left of Yugoslavia into submission, and the war ended with a UN resolution which dictated Yugoslav forces retreat and governance of the region be temporarily handed to the UN.\n\nThis was the end of the armed conflict for the most part. Then, in 2008, nearly a decade after the war, Kosovo declared itself independent. The US was the first to acknowledge this declaration of independence.\n\n(Before we move on to the actual argument and to keep things short, i am not against NATO intervention in the region, but rather US recognition of Kosovo)\n\n  \nThis has lead to the rise of what is Known as the Kosovo independence precedent. It is an argument of self-determination that dictates that separatist groups do in fact have a legal right to declare independence despite there being no legal framework for it in the original country's law.\n\nMany separatist movements around the world have been spurred on by this idea, and many have quickly pointed out that the US is being selective in its support of these when it supported Kosovo. The United states when faced with this has claimed Kosovo was a special case because of the repression they faced under Yugoslav rule, but to me it doesn't really make sense as an excuse, don't most minorities face repression and lack of representation? I might be a bit cynical, but it seems to me like the US is trying to save face and pull a \"Two wrongs don't make a right\" and avoid other separatist movements from arising when it has personally benefited from one.\n\n  \nFast forward some years, many separatist movements cite the precedent to support their cause, and most notably Vladimir Putin has (Obviously with his own political motives) cited the precedent to justify his invasion of Ukraine and the referendums of the Russian republics seeking to form within its territory. The US is obviously staunchly against this and against other separatist movements, which in my view makes their position hypocritical.\n\nThus i reach out to hear other opinions, considering that I have no non-biased people to talk about it in my life, seeing how this a very contentious topic in the local political sphere\n\n",

        "selftext": "I believe that the favorite for the 2024 election should be deemed as Donald Trump even though the polls technically show Harris on top or even. \n\nMy first point is Pennsylvania's similarity to Ohio. Ohio is a state that Democrats used to have a chance in and blew it. I think that Democrats are on a consistent trend of making Pennsylvania into the new Ohio, which would de facto lock them out of the Presidency.\n\nWhen we look at why Democrats lost their Ohio chances, it is due to the loss of blue collar worker voters who held their nose on socially conservative issues to vote Democrat for unions. These people stopped doing that in Ohio. If they stopped in Ohio, I don't see why they would stop voting Dem in Pennsylvania.\n\nThere are multiple reasons for this. First, Pennsylvania has a huge Jewish population, and there is speculation that Jews will shift very rightwards due to Gaza and not seeing Democrats as aggresively pro Israel enough. \n\nAnother issue is that the 2022 midterm election was heavily affected by abortion. Now, in 2024, abortion, while on the ballot in many states, is no longer an issue that pro choice Americans feel strongly about like they did after *Roe* was repealed. They say time heals all wounds, and this wound has been healed by time.\n\nAnother thing is that very few people talk about flipping swing states where Trump is up. People are talking about Trump flipping Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. Much fewer people are talking about Harris flipping Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina. If you're deemed a favorite, you should have a significant enough chance of flipping swing states to the point that the media talks about it frequently. ",

        "author": "Philipofish",
        "selftext": "The idea of a population collapse is often portrayed as a looming crisis, but i argue that it\u2019s a narrative driven by billionaires to serve their own interests. By framing declining birthrates as a dire threat, they can push policies and societal changes that ultimately benefit their wealth and power. This perspective suggests that the real concern for billionaires isn\u2019t the well-being of society, but rather the potential impact on their future customer base, the possibility of increased taxes to support social security, and the likelihood of rising wages due to a tighter labor market. \n\n1. Future Customer Base:\nBillionaires are acutely aware that their future customer base is dependent on today's birthrates. In 15 years, the children born today will become the primary consumers of goods and services. A decline in birthrates means a smaller future market, which could lead to reduced profits and slower economic growth. This potential shrinkage in the consumer base is a significant concern for businesses that rely on continuous market expansion to sustain their revenue streams.\n\n2. Taxation and Social Security:\nA declining population can strain social security systems, as there will be fewer workers to support an aging population. To compensate for this imbalance, governments might need to increase taxes, particularly on the wealthy, to fund social security and other public services. Billionaires, who often benefit from lower tax rates and various tax loopholes, are likely opposed to any changes that would increase their tax burden. They prefer maintaining the status quo, where they can maximize their wealth without additional financial obligations to the state.\n\n3. Wage Increases for Workers:\nWith a lower population, the labor market could tighten, leading to increased competition for workers. This scenario would drive up wages as companies vie for a limited pool of talent. Higher wages mean increased operational costs for businesses, which could cut into their profit margins. Billionaires, who own and invest in these businesses, would prefer a larger labor pool that keeps wages competitive and operational costs lower. Thus, they are concerned that declining birthrates could disrupt this balance, leading to higher wages and reduced profitability.\n",

        "selftext": "Online and in person, people seem to love to tell other people what beliefs they \"should\" hold and what they \"should\" do.\n\nI think this is bad!\n\nIt's **disrespectful**. One of the foundations of showing other people respect is respecting their autonomy. People have the right to make decisions about their life without outside influence. When you try to persuade someone, you're undermining this right--or at least trying to.\n\nIt's also **rude**. There's an unspoken assertion behind any kind of persuasion, which is \"I know better than you do.\" This is at least slightly insulting if unsolicited.\n\nAnd it's often **wrong**. In my experience, it's pretty hard to know what we ought to be doing with our lives and what we ought to believe. We all have different experiences, values, and goals. Our decisions are built on the foundation of all kinds of idiosyncratic things about our lives and minds that other people often don't have access to. What is right for me may not be right, or even relevant, for someone else.\n\nI don't think this means we can't talk about topics where we don't agree, or that we can't share opinions that differ from others. I only think it's better to try not to persuade. The respectful alternative to persuasion is good old-fashioned conversation. Tell people about your beliefs and experiences. Ask them about theirs.\n\nSome details:\n\n* Sometimes we might decide we are willing to disrespect someone! Say my friend is trying to heal their child's cancer with crystals instead of medicine. I think I would try very hard to persuade them to call a doctor instead. It would still be inherently disrespectful -- I don't get a pass on that -- but in this case the kid's health would take precedence over respecting my friend.\n* If someone asks you for your opinion or advice (in this subreddit for example!), you're no longer undermining their authority, so we're good to go. You still *could* be insulting and disrespectful, but it's not *inherently* those things anymore.\n* The degree to which unsolicited persuasion is disrespectful and insulting depends on how closely-held the belief is. Trying to persuade someone to try a sandwich you think they'll like is very minimally disrespectful. Trying to persuade someone to stop or start eating meat is highly disrespectful.\n\nEDIT: Some of the early commenters sure seem to feel disrespected by my view about how they live their lives! \ud83d\ude44",

        "author": "forbiddenmemeories",
        "selftext": "I've seen a fair few posts and comments on social media within the past year likening the current Israeli government to Nazi Germany on account of the current war in the Middle East and their treatment of Palestinians in the years prior. I generally think comparisons to Nazi Germany tend to be hyperbolic, but I'm not really seeking to discuss here whether the comparison is warranted or not; rather, I want to present my view for criticism on what the implications of considering Israel akin to Nazi Germany would be re. what the Western powers should be doing about the current situation, given what they did when faced with Nazi Germany.\n\nPlenty of people in countries like the US and UK are advocating for their governments to withdraw some or all support for Israel over their actions or to make any further support conditional on them stopping the war and improving their human rights record. There have been policies advocated for like banning sales of arms to Israel, placing economic sanctions on them or companies with ties to the Israeli government. Similar policies have been pursued in the past with regimes such as apartheid-era South Africa or currently with Russia following their invasion of Ukraine. But if you were to sincerely hold the position that Israel's current regime and actions are comparable to Nazi Germany and their actions in the 1930s and 40s such as invading its neighbours and carrying out the Holocaust, policies like these surely do not go *nearly* far enough as a response. Would boycotting Hugo Boss or refusing to trade with Hitler have been a sufficient response in 1939 when Germany invaded Poland, or would a cessation of hostilities at that point have been enough to justify the Allies going back to leaving them alone? The vast majority of people would say no, surely.\n\nTherefore, for anyone espousing the view that the current Israeli government truly is comparable to the Nazi government of Germany in the 1930s/40s, it seems logical to me that they should be advocating for much the same response from nations like the US and UK right now: that those countries should go to war with Israel insofar as is necessary until the current Israeli government has been removed from power, and annex the country and rebuild its political institutions from the ground up until such time as they're deemed capable of self-governance again, like they did with Germany in the 1940s. And if someone who ostensibly believes that the current Israeli government is comparable to the Nazis is *not* advocating for this viewpoint, I can only draw one of the following conclusions:\n\n1. They do not, in fact, sincerely believe that the current Israeli government is as bad as the Nazis.\n\nor\n\n2. They think the West's response to the Nazis in 1939-45 was excessive and that less extreme measures should have been taken instead.\n\nGiven the near-universal regard for the Allies' actions in World War II as legitimate and a proportionate response to Nazi Germany, I would assume that the vast majority of people who describe Israel as comparable today to Nazi Germany fall into category 1 rather than category 2, i.e. believing that the current Israeli government and their actions are *wrong* and deserving of *some* punitive measures in response, but not really that they are comparable to the wrongs of the Nazis or deserving of similar punitive measures as levelled against Nazi Germany.\n\nThe most obvious criticism of this view I can think of would be to argue that the decision of countries like the US and UK to go to war with Nazi Germany was motivated not merely by opposition to Germany's current actions but also by interests of self-defence with the threat that they too were likely to be attacked by Germany in the near future, whereas Israel seem extremely unlikely to be a credible threat to anyone other than their immediate neighbours. This is a valid line of argument, but in the context of my post I would say that I think it is also very unlikely that *this* is the reason why most people who compare Israel to Nazi Germany are not advocating for a military response to Israel. My reasoning there is that most people's support of measures against Israel such as economic sanctions surely aren't based on fears of Israel being a threat to the West, but rather on the feeling that punitive measures against Israel are the morally right course of action because of their crimes against their immediate neighbours such as Gaza and Lebanon; ergo, I'd assume that someone in the US or UK advocating for these types of economic measures against Israel, but *not* for a war to topple them, is doing so not because they feel a war would be unnecessary for their own country's safety, but rather because they do not think Israel's crimes are bad *enough* to warrant their own country declaring war in response as they did against Nazi Germany.\n\nAnyway, this is my view.

        "selftext": "Unions striking over jobs lost to technological advancements and automation does nothing but hinder economic progress and innovation. Technology often leads to increased efficiency, lower costs, and the creation of new jobs in emerging industries. Strikes that seek to preserve outdated roles or resist automation can stifle companies' ability to remain competitive and adapt to a rapidly changing market. Additionally, preventing or delaying technological advancements due to labor disputes could lead to overall economic stagnation, reducing the ability of businesses to grow, invest in new opportunities, and ultimately generate new types of employment. Instead, the focus should be on equipping workers with skills for new roles created by technological change rather than trying to protect jobs that are becoming obsolete.\n\nNow I believe there is an argument to be made that employees have invested themselves into a business and helped it reach a point where it can automate and become more efficient. I don't deny that there might be compensation owed in this respect when jobs are lost due to technology, but that does not equate to preserving obsolete jobs.\n\nI'm open to all arguments but the quickest way to change my mind would be to show me how preserving outdated and obsolete jobs would be of benefit to the company or at least how it could be done without negatively impacting the company's ability to compete against firms that pursue automation.\n\n\n**Edit:**\n\nThese are great responses so far and you guys have me thinking.

        "selftext": "There is a emphasis these days (although it has been going on for a while, but I think it's been getting worse recently) on policing language and coming up with new (more \"politically correct\") terms to replace old ones, and people are sometimes \"corrected\"/chastised if they say the wrong thing.\n\nBy this, I'm talking about things like:\n- Saying \"unhoused\" instead of \"homeless.\"\n- Saying \"differently abled\" instead of \"disabled\"/\"handicapped.\"\n- Saying \"person with autism\" instead of \"autistic.\"\n- Saying \"special\"/\"intellectually disabled\" instead of the \"r word.\" (There are so many conflicting euphemisms for disability that it's hard to tell what's actually acceptable.)\n- Saying \"little person\" instead of \"midget.\"\n- Saying \"Latinx\" instead of \"Latino/Latina.\"\n- Saying \"intersex\" instead of \"hermaphrodite.\"\n- Saying \"POC\" (person of color) instead of \"minority\"/\"colored person.\"\n- Etc. (There are many other examples.)\n\nThis is basically pointless IMO because the real problem with these terms is that they have a negative connotation, so just replacing the word with a new one won't actually get rid of the negative connotation. This is called the \"euphemism treadmill.\" George Carlin also talked about this (although that was a long time ago, and it's arguably gotten much worse since then).\n\nFor example, a lot of people nowadays have started using \"autistic\" as an insult, even though it is considered the proper word to use (and the \"r word\" is now considered offensive). People have even started to use internet variations of \"autistic\" and the \"r word\" (not sure if I could actually say it without getting banned), such as \"acoustic\" or \"restarted,\" to insult people. So basically, it didn't really do anything since being autistic is still seen as negative by society.\n\nI think that someone's actions and how they treat people generally matter more than what specific words they use since you could still just use the \"correct\" terms as an insult or use the \"wrong\" terms with good intentions (especially if you are old and are used to the old terms).",

        "author": "RJFallen",
        "selftext": "The following is a quote from Vance after being asked about the creation of a federal policy monitoring agency:\n\n\u201c\u2026 Now, of course, Donald Trump has been very clear that on the abortion policy specifically, that we have a big country and it's diverse. And California has a different viewpoint on this than Georgia. Georgia has a different viewpoint from Arizona. And the proper way to handle this, as messy as democracy sometimes is, is to let voters make these decisions, let the individual states make their abortion policy. And I think that's what makes the most sense in a very big, a very diverse, and let's be honest, sometimes a very, very messy and divided country.\u201d\n\nVance clearly states that he believes abortion policy should be left to the states (instead of being at the federal level) because states have different viewpoints. By adopting this position, it can be inferred that Vance would be ok with, for example, California allowing abortion until the 22nd week and Texas banning it altogether. In other words, he is saying that the collective shouldn\u2019t decide for the individual members of the group since these members have different viewpoints.\n\nNow let\u2019s shift from [Federal Level = Collective and States = Individual Members] to [States = Collective and People = Individual Members] and apply the exact same logic. Individuals within a state also have different viewpoints. Therefore, a person that resides in a state (individual member) shouldn\u2019t be forced to abide by what the state (collective) decides. For example, if Mary (State X resident) wants to get an abortion for whatever reason at week 10, she should be allowed to do so regardless of what other State X residents believe. This is the definition of being pro-choice. Not being ok with this is in contradiction with the initial argument since it would imply that we are fine with letting the collective decide over an individual with a differing viewpoint.\n\nNote: This CMV is exclusively about the logical conclusion of Vance\u2019s statement during the debate. I\u2019m not making any assumption on whether he is right/wrong or if he actually meant what he said.  Pointing out implications that may arise from applying the same logic to other areas will not CMV. ",

        "author": "stealthyalfredo",
        "selftext": "\nBefore we begin my post, I would like to define a couple of things.\n\n***Definitions***\n\nShipping - Desire by fans for two or more fictional characters to be in a romantic relationship.\n\nFandom culture - Subculture of fans sharing a common interest\n\nCanon - something that is established in the official work\n\nFanon - completely the opposite of canon; often ideas and concepts made by the fans that are commonly used in fanfiction and fandoms but do not exist in the official work.\n\nOkay the reason why this post is being made is because I would like to be offered a new perspective on shipping. Me personally, I only ship the canon ships as they hold more validity and often have more content than the fanon ships and there's barely any fights about the canon ships as nobody can deny that it was written there on purpose. I have two main arguments.\n\n**1. It often detracts from discussions about the actual work**\n\nSomething I have observed in most large fandoms (mostly anime ones, I'm not too sure if it applies to other fandoms but i mainly participate in anime fandoms) is that 99% of the fancontent and discussion is about ships and rarely it is about the actual story. Oftentimes when ships are brought up, someone else brings up another conflicting ship and people have an argument about which ship is better. This is distracting and buries other posts and comments that are legitimately talking about the actual story and not about the ship + it's petty and lame.\n\n**2. Most ships will never be canon and people treating it like it is canon shouldn't be so prevalent**\n\nMost characters that are shipped together have purely platonic relations with each other and there's no romantic tension involved. The only way you could possibly think it is romantic is if you make absurd conclusions and reaches. Before you mention ships that could be interpreted either way, I am talking about the relationships where the only possible and logical way to interpret them is platonic. Regardless, people still see two characters talk to each other once and think \"they must be dating!!! ship!!\". It's ridiculous and they should let two characters be friends for once without making everything romantic.\n\nNow I will refute arguments I will inevitably see on this post\n\n\"It's just for fun!\" If the only way to have fun is to put every character you see in a romantic relationship, then you have bigger problems and you need to find different ways to have fun. \n\n\"Well just ignore it\" I am unable to ignore it when 99% of fancontent is SHIP SHIP SHIPPITY SHIP\n\n\"It's for exploration of character dynamics\" You can very well explore character dynamics and not put them in a romantic relationship every time\n\n\"The whole basis of fandom culture is built on ships\" This is true but fandom culture should more so be built on the actual content surrounding the work instead of just the ships and nothing else.\n\nedit: spelling \n\nEdit 2; I completely forgot how to outline how to change my view more clearly. In order to change my view you have to tell me the benefits of shipping and why that outweighs the harms. This offers me a new perspective on shipping. Telling me \u201cit\u2019s not that deep\u201d doesn\u2019t change my view. \n\nEdit 3: I don\u2019t get why redditors are assuming that I want fandom culture changed just because I made a post about it. I would love if it did to be my idealized version but it\u2019s been like this for years so it\u2019s unrealistic. It\u2019s not like I even comment on posts with shipping. I just block the shippers I don\u2019t like. ",

        "author": "insect_ligaments",
        "selftext": "The legal concept of marriage, where spouses act as partners, is almost always built on mutual trust that certain aspects of the relationship, such as sex, are to be exclusive to the relationship unless agreed upon otherwise. Legally and financially rewarding spouses for betraying the trust of their spouse by allowing a cheating spouse to come out ahead in divorce undermines one of the key relationship dynamics in our society.\n\nFor the vast majority of people, entering into marriage is an explicit agreement that unless divorced or otherwise agreed upon, the people in the marriage will not have sex with or develop romantic relationships with other people. This should apply evenly to all genders, and if you view this as benefitting one over the other, it says a lot about your view on who may or may not be more likely to cheat.\n\nBefore I'm accused of being some kind of conservative or traditionalist: I have zero issue with any form of LGBTQ+ relationship or poly setup. I'm speaking strictly to traditional, legally recognized, monogamous marriages, which comprise the bulk of those in our society. I'm also not religious or socially conservative.\n\nHeading off a few arguments that I do not find convincing (of course, you are welcome to offer additional insight on these points I haven't considered):\n\n1) \"The government shouldn't be involved in marriage\"\n\nToo late for that. Marriage is a legally binding agreement that affects debt, assets, legal liability, taxes, homebuying, and other fundamental aspects of our lives. The end of marriage has profound, legally enforceable consequences on both parties. It is also included in a pre-existing legal doctrine of\u00a0https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alienation\\_of\\_affections.\n\n2) \"But what if the spouses want to open their marriage?\"\n\nTotally fine. My post is in reference to the most common form of marriage, which is monogamous.\n\n3) \"Adultery doesn't have a clear definition\"\n\nIt does. \"voluntary sexual\u00a0[intercourse](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=05826a3c56c67289&sca_upv=1&rlz=1C1ONGR_enUS1127US1127&q=intercourse&si=ACC90nwZrNcJVJVL0KSmGGq5Ka2Y_LZNCuz-rXf3RWbWGZD0YFuvQ0gck8iv_I-vXEsPMmDpeldPlTyUN0FJ6k9nx2_KAjj_QmEabPxsAQcdvs4E9R8NkyU%3D&expnd=1&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj_k-r92u2IAxVAMdAFHaqNGncQyecJegQIOhAO)\u00a0between a married person and a person who is not his or her spouse.\" \"Sexual intercourse\" would include all the commonly recognized forms of sex. This would have to be proven via the typical preponderance standard, which is greater than 50% odds, via typical evidence used to evidence behaviors - depositions/testimony under oath, any written or photographic evidence, circumstantial evidence, etc.\n\n4) \"What should the legal consequences be?\"\n\nAt the very least, immediate forfeiture of any rights to alimony or spousal support. Shifts in the default assumption of a 50/50 split of marital assets are another route to explore. Certainly not enough to leave anyone destitute, though.\n\n5) \"What about children?\"\n\nChild support is a separate issue, as it affects the child, who has no say in one of their parents cheating on the other.",

After these attacks not a single Israeli citizen would be OK with either Hezbollah or Hamas remaining close to the our border and with enough capabilities to harm Israeli civilians. In my eyes, the ultimate goal of Israel is to ensure the complete safety of it's citizens, which means not just respond to those attacks but prevent future ones. If Israel was to respond proportionaly to these attacks those groups would still threaten Israel's national security and it's citizens lives. \n\nAs such, I believe that Israeli operations should completely disregard proportionality and focus on maintaining the country's national secruity. \n\nA note: \nIn calling for non - proportional response I do not in any way call for targeting/intentionally harming innocent civilians, I believe that Israel should minimise harm to civilians as much as possible and ensure their safety wherever it can.\n\nEDIT: \n\nAfter reading the responses and doing a quick search on the legal definition of proportionality I realise my OP's premise was simply wrong from the get go and I was simply uninformed. \n\nI won't really say my opinion is changed though, rather I would say that because of my misunderstanding of the terms I used my OP didn't really reflect my opinion correctly. \n\nThanks for everyone. \n\nEDIT 2: Incase it wasn't obvious from the first edit, while writing this post I didn't knkw the correct meaning of \"proportionality\", I now do know, view changed.

        "selftext": "I hear many activists wanting Xinjiang to be independent because of Chinese oppression and cultural erasure. I understand those claims well and want Uyghur culture to survive. However, I feel like both regions being independent would just cause more problems than solve the problem of self determination.\n\nFirstly, there are many Han Chinese people living in Xinjiang. How would you deal with them? Do you expect an anti-China Uyghur government to treat its Han Chinese ethnicities benevolently? Likely, they would be killed off or removed from the land they live on. Many people may argue that since the Chinese settled on illegal land, they should leave. The problem with that line of thinking is that the Uyghurs also settled on illegal land that stole from the Dzungars. And China had pressence in Xinjiang far before the Uyghurs ever arrived there as far back as the Han Dynasty. \n\nSecondly, Xinjiang contains many minority groups like Kazakhs, Mongolians, Kyrgyz, Tajiks, Russians, and Tibetans. Why should you want to establish an Uyghur supremacist state over Xinjiang? If you suggest a multi-ethnic state like India, good luck, because it might not happen. It may just explode into civil war like Yugoslavia. India actually got divided between its Muslim population and Hindu population in 1947 with the creation of Pakistan. Millions of people died in the bloodshed. \n\nThirdly, it is not ensured that Xinjiang will become a liberal democracy either, since most Uyghurs are socially conservative and religious, which might give rise to a theocracy. If they try secularism, they are lucky, but how likely is it to happen? When you are fighting to protect your identity, your beliefs are probably more socially conservative. \n\nFourthly, there are Uyghurs and other minorities that support the Chinese government. This might sound fake, but it's certainly not. 10-20% of Americans are pro-China even though China is an enemy state. What will happen to them once the new Xinjiang state comes into power? Will they get persecuted for previously supporting the Chinese government? Will they be imprisoned or expelled from their homeland. \n\nWhile Chinese persecution of Uyghurs is a problem, creating an Uyghur state creates 5 more. \n\nThe best way to contain Uyghur culture is to practice it in places that allow cultural freedom. When the Chinese government becomes more tolerant of other ethnic groups, the Uyghurs living out of China will come back and repromote Uyghur culture. This is a better way to preserve Uyghur culture than granting independence.",

These are often just the politician in question parroting back prepared, semi-relevant, statements. Without wanting to risk saying something foolish, and not knowing the questions ahead of time, this is probably the best most people can do in that situation. It would be much more interesting if they knew what questions they would be asked. \n\nThe ability to give a good answer to a question you were not expecting, is not a very good indicator of intelligence or ability to govern. When a President (or other leader) has to make an important decision, they don't have to make it immediately without a chance to talk to their advisors. That's not how it works. Even in a true crisis situation, the President has multiple minutes to decide and can talk to advisors first. It is the decisions that they make in these circumstances, not unexpected ones, that makes a person a good leader. \n\nIf a politician is asked a question on a difficult topic, that they had 48 hours notice of, and they can't give a good answer; that implies that they won't govern well on that issue. They could not give a good answer even when they had the benefit of others writing their answers for them. If they can't give a good answer to a surprise question, that doesn't really mean anything. No one knows everything about all issues. If anything, politicians can currently feign ignorance to avoid answering a question. This is not a viable tactic if the audience know that they had pre-knowledge of the questions. \n\nI am NOT stating that politicians should only be asked scripted questions. There is obviously a place for follow up questions and questions from the audience. I am stating that having them be briefed on the questions 48 hours in advance should be the standard. \n\nI do accept that politicians could refuse to be asked questions on certain topics. However, they can do that now to an extent. Whilst they can refuse to attend the interview if they don't like the questions, they cannot avoid the media outlet revealing that this happened and what questions they wouldn't answer. A question that a politician refuses to answer could haunt them for a whole campaign under these circumstances. \n\nEdit for clarity: I am talking about political interviews. My view applies only to political interviews. There is another type of political forum that I am not suggesting any changes to. This starts with D and rhymes with 'rebate'.

So, a driver who drinks alcohol then kills someone while driving is an asshole, and a driver going 90mph on the freeway is also an asshole even if they don\u2019t get in an accident because they pose a danger to everyone else. Likewise, a bicyclist blowing through stop lights and almost causing car accidents or hitting pedestrians is an asshole.\n\nThere are over 200 million registered drivers in the US compared with an estimated ~50 million bicyclists. There are millions of car accidents per year involving tens of thousands of deaths. There are only tens of thousands of bike accidents per year and less than a thousand deaths. So, by the numbers, there are way more drivers harming and endangering other people compared to bicyclists. If you scale the number of accidents/deaths by relative number of drivers/cyclists, the numbers are closer, but that doesn\u2019t account for the difference in severity of driving vs. cycling accidents \n\nBicyclists have less physical capability of harming others compared to drivers. A bicyclist running through a red light can certainly cause harm to others, but the scale of the harm is far less due to the size difference (thousands of pounds vs hundreds of pounds). Not to mention that some states have implemented laws allowing \u201cIdaho stops\u201d where a bicyclist treats a stop sign like a yield sign and a stoplight like a stop and wait until safe sign, which have been shown to be safer for drivers and bicyclists.\n\nI am definitely open to changing my opinion, but I haven\u2019t seen any evidence that bicyclists harm or endanger more than drivers.

One of the most common bumper sticker types is some sort of jab at someone following too close along the lines of \"if you can read this you're following too damn close.\" It's probably even more common than political bumper stickers. Every time I'm being driven by someone who hates tailgaters I find myself in awe of the agony and distress they experience if someone is following them a little close.\n\nImagine my shock when I first started driving and realized it doesn't matter at all. I seldom even notice it happening and when I do I have no reaction whatsoever. Follow me as close as you want. I have never once been rear ended because I failed to notice I was being tailgated. In fact I have never been in a driving accident at all.\n\n\"But the point is they're risking an accident.\" So? A rear end is one of the least likely accidents to injure anyone inside the front car, and these accidents have some of the clearest liability for the person in back. Yes you'll have to wait to get your car fixed/replaced but it will not cost you a dime. And like I said, I've never experienced an accident of this type in 10 years of driving ignoring tailgaters so it cannot be that common.\n\nIt's certainly not common enough to warrant a strong emotional reaction when you notice someone is following close. Is experiencing seething anger 1000 times worth it to maybe avoid a fender bender one time?\n\nBased on the prevalence and increasingly hostile messaging of anti-tailgater bumper stickers you would think it's one of the worst problems with driving in America, but I wouldn't even place it in my top ten. Now, I will admit it's an issue at night when someone is blasting their brights at you but that's more an issue with aggressive use of brights, not following too close.\n\n(and to get ahead of the *ad hominem* attacks, I do not follow close.

        "selftext": "For me, I think the UK has the best Democratic system by far. When we look at the US system, imo, it's a system that was good pre Westward expansion. There were 13-20ish states (depending on time period) where states were reasonably unified, and even small states had a population to grow. \n\nHowever, what the US system failed to account for was just how many more states we'd get, and how much power some of the smaller states would get, and how many times we'd draw ultra small states when we could have just combined a few states. I don't believe that the founders would've been ok with Wyoming or North Dakota being as powerful as they are, but they'd have wanted smaller states to have *some* defense, given that some of the early 13 colonies were smaller. What I'm getting at is that the founders would've wanted small states to have some defense and thus created the Senate and Electoral College, but they would've never wanted us to go Westward and create a bunch of smaller states to rule over the OG 13 colonies. In a way, by expanding Westward, the OG US states set themselves up to be ruled over by the Mountain West states or the Great Plains states. All that is to say the US system started off as a great system that did not function well once the country was expanded.\n\nOn the other hand, you have the other extreme. Total democracy. Personally, I don't agree that full democracy is a mob rule situation but it has its downsides. The way I see it a simple 50/50 should not always get to create new laws unless that 50/50 is well distributed. \n\nAnd that is exactly why I'm an enthusiast of the UK system. I see it as a sort of compromise between a system that is fully US Senate like and simple majority rule. It allows everyone to be represented, but it prevents tyranny of the minority because almost all districts (excluding 5/600+ districts in the UK) must be drawn to be roughly equal in population nationally.\n\n Yes, a majority can go a longer way than it can in the US, but it the same time, everywhere is represented by districts, so sure, you could try appealing mainly to Liverpool and London and that can take you far, or you may fall short in the number of Parliamentary seats,, but if you have a party that truly appeals to a simple majority everywhere, you are on the path to a supermajority victory. At the same time, the districts are roughly equal in population nationally, so this prevents extreme minority or rural rule. \n\nAlso, the elections for Parliament and PM are de facto combined which is good for reducing voter fatigue.",

        "author": "BluePillUprising",
        "selftext": "\nThe way race is categorized in the United States makes little sense to me.  The exceptions to this statement are the terms \"African-American\" and \"American Indian\", though I personally prefer the term indigenous person or First Nation.\n\nThe reason for this is that both the native population of the continent and the descendants of enslaved Africans who were transported across the Atlantic from the 16-19th centuries have suffered appalling injustice and deserve some kind of recompensation for that.  Whether that be monetary or in the form of some kind of benefit is open for debate.  The point is that both of these populations have a common heritage of systemic and institutional oppression and it seems logical to me to categorize them under that standard. \n\nBut I reject outright the terms \"white\", \"black\", \"Hispanic\" or \"Latino\" and, most of all, \"Asian\".\n\nAll of these so-called categories are essentially meaningless and I think it would make more sense to do away with them completely and to focus more on a household income and educational attainment when looking at demography. \n\nLet us start with so-called \"white people\"  who are said to have privilege.  \n\nWhat exactly is a white person?\n\nIf it is the descendent of someone who abused and enslaved the native population of the continent and who benefitted from the labor of enslaved Africans then surely said privilege exists.  But if it is simply a person who has fair skin, then the assertion is completely without merit.  \n\nTo take just one example, we now have hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian refugees in the United States, all of whom appear to be \"white\" but they have no systemic benefits.  They and their ancestors played no part in the institutional discrimination of the past, they come from one of the poorest countries in Europe with a legacy of genocide and deprivation inflicted on them by outsiders and one could even make the case, that they are in fact victims of geopolitical adventurism by the U.S. government.  \n\nThat is, of course, debatable but what is not is that they have nothing in common with the descendents of English and German settlers who came hundreds of years ago other than skin tone.  \n\nThere is no such thing as \u201cwhite people\u201d. \n\nThe same goes for the term \"black\".  The descendents of enslaved Africans share nothing with recent immigrants from Ethiopia or Nigeria or Kenya, many of whom are representatives of the most elite classes of their native countries and are travelling to the United States to enter universities and high level jobs. The only thing that they share with African Americans is dark skin.  Their language, culture, and historical experience are completely different.  \n\nWhat about Latinos?  Here we can at least claim that there is a claim of common Spanish heritage, right?  Well, no actually. Not if you factor in Brazil which is the giant of the region but, even then, what does a person from Dominican Republic, where most people are descended from enslaved Africans have in common with a person from Argentina where most people are descended from 19th century European immigrants or someone from Mexico where most people are of mixed European and Spanish heritage.  Does this category make sense?  \n\nThe answer is no. \n\nFinally, most absurd and frankly, Eurocentric is the category, \"Asian\"\n\nWhat is Asia? Is it even a thing?\n\nNo. It's just the part of the European landmass that is not populated primarily by people with fair skin. But is there any common linguistic, cultural or historical  heritage between a person born in China and a person born in India?  Is a Russian person from Vladivostok Asian, what about a Turkish person from Ankara?  Neither of them fits the description of what Americans traditionally think of when they hear the term \"Asian\" and both could easily be categorized as \"white\" but huge swaths of both Russia and Turkey are considered to be part of the \u201cAsian\u201d continent by most American and European atlases.  So, I guess they are? Right? Probably not in the understanding of most people. \n\nSo just what the hell is Asian and what do Asians have in common with one another?  Nothing.   \n\nYou might think that I'm being pedantic or nitpicking but there are real world consequences for how these terms are applied.  Until very recently, it was considered legal to discriminate against Asians in university admissions, for example, based on the fact that they are disproportionately represented in higher education?  But who are \"they\"?\n\nCan anybody really claim that such a thing as a \"white person\" or a \"black person\" or an \"Asian\" or a \"Latino\" really exist?  Am I missing some logic or benefit from categorizing people in this way?",

I think if you don\u2019t believe that markets are good, their isn\u2019t a good reason to disagree with me\n\nHowever, I believe that some times, markets can incentivize behavior that the government should disincentivize or stop. For example, we have the \u201ctragedy of the commons\u201d situation with climate change. Sometimes people are willing to pay for things that are bad, which is why we have taxes on drugs for example. \n\nI believe that despite the fact that this boarding system is the most profitable and generates the most \u201ceconomic value\u201d, the product being sold is ultimately a negative service. Peoples time are wasted so that the people in the front can have a sense of arrogance for all the lower-class people that walk by them. This seems to be a service that though people are willing to pay for, but is not a valuable service. \n\nefficient boarding methods means more, cheaper flights. This can help reduce the profit loss, but even if there is a profit loss, that means that the market has been distorted by airlines getting more money for a socially invaluable service. That money could be better spent on other things. \n\nI guess there is also the overhead bin issue, but the number of people that will be forced to check their (or something else) bag is still the same, so there isn\u2019t any value to that. \n\nThe other possible objection is that this is more inefficient regulatory paperwork, but I believe it won\u2019t be necessary since the government is already in the airports and can catch the airlines very easily if they break this rule.

Stuff like the electric chair is a thing of the past (since that is considered cruel and unusual punishment). So basically, they just die peacefully and don't have to face the full length of punishment for their crimes. I think it's worse to be forced to be in prison for the rest of your life thinking about what you did (and probably getting assaulted by the other inmates, honestly, if the crime was especially bad, like if it involved a woman or a kid).\n\nAnd if you believe in some sort of Hell (I don't personally), then they have all of eternity to be punished once they eventually die. Why rush it? They can suffer on Earth and in the afterlife, as well.

But in my eyes the technological advances like the steam engine, railroad, steamboats, telegraph etc. (which can't be directly tied to colonialism) simply have at least equal impact.\n\nDevices like the spinning jenny increased the worker productivity by more than [two orders of magnitude within a generation](https://web.archive.org/web/20120301220936/http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Admin/PUB/Documents/RR-89-001.pdf). The Euro-Atlantic attitude to innovation and science, which was relatively unique for the time,  ensured that goods could be manufactured at previously unthinkably low effort. These effects snowballed and launched Europe and the US into unprecedented wealth.\n\nI understand that the colonialism helped with sustaining this growth by providing raw materials and open markets for the abundance of goods. But I still believe that this wealth divergence would happen neverthless even though to a somewhat lesser extent. The increase in productivity during the industrial revolution was simply too large.\n\nOther major powers like China or the Ottoman Empire also had access to very large amount of raw materials, some had colonies of their own, many used slavery...

There's an argument to be made about when exactly a caricature of a person's actual features becomes this, but I digress. This almost exclusively includes the original shoe shine on the face, avoiding the lips and eyes to make them look larger, and anything that obviously evokes that aesthetic.\n\nI do not believe that cases of people using makeup to give themselves a realistic dark skin tone, or even caes of being painted fully black for some unnatural aesthetic, usually cosplay, are examples of blackface.\n\nNow, it mostly comes down to Intent. Which is not always easy to judge, and people can lie. But I believe it's harmful to just put a blanket condemnation of all these things without trying to understand the purpose behind what someone is doing.

        "selftext": "CMV: I do not think that the root cause of the increase in carbon emissions is carbon emitting vehicles or the use of \"non-renewable\" energy at a commercial level.\n\nI do think that the increase is directly related to the general human tendency to over consume and underutilize, and waste. I would like to explain my reasoning.\n\nCommerical organizations only exist to make a profit. If they did not do so they would not exist. Which also means they would never offer a product or service that would not bring sustainable profits. If that is true than we can conclude that businesses only exist to serve the demands of a consumer. Therefore any increase in operations and the associated carbon emissions would be due to an increase in demand from the consumer.\n\nIf that is true than to reduce the amount of emissions from commercial operations there is a need to reduce the waste caused by the consumer. Especially for commodities, food, and discretionary spending. I believe that this would solve the core issue of the increase in commercial carbon emissions.\n\nI am open to changing my mind if I am provided a view that is based of logical reasoning.\n\n\nEDIT:\n\nIt seems I have indirectly communicated some views that I do not hold. I would like to clarify:\n\n1) I am not anti-commerce. I think communities as a whole are more efficient and sustainable when individual contributions have the intent to preserve and propel the community and not to self-service.\n\n2) I am not anti-crude oil or anti-emissions. Nor am I anti-EV/ZEV. I am also not anti-renewables. I am of the belief that there is a optimal balance between crude and renewable.\n\n3) My views are strictly around the source of the increase in carbon emissions, not that carbon emissions are necessarily bad or good. I think too much emphasis is placed on organization being at fault and taking initiatives to reduce waste. When more emphasis should be placed on reducing waste at the individual consumer level.\n\n",

Womens basketball is boring and only the NBA is worth watching, etc... Don't even get me started on trying to flex my New York Liberty season tickets. Recently wbb has been trending a bit, and only one thing has really changed between then and now: Men have decided it's cool. I see men online talking about Caitlyn Clark, Paige Bueckers, etc... and how they're all goated, which is true, but it's like all of a sudden now that men have decided that this is a \"real\" sport and something that \"real sports fans\" invest time and interest in, everyone switched up. I'm glad it's getting recognition, but it's a bit upsetting and invalidating.\n\nEdit: I want everyone to watch women's college basketball. I love it, and I hope other people love it too (including men). What I'm upset about is the fact that it was considered pretty much a joke and not a valid sports pastime until men started watching it. When it had a primarily female fanbase, it wasn't taken seriously. Now that more men watch, it is. I grew up being made fun of for my interest in it, and now the script has flipped because of male interest in it. It's frustrating.\n\nEdit 2: If you're intentionally misunderstanding the post and commenting about how \"everyone hates men nowdays\", please stop. It's a good thing men are watching wbb. What is irking me is the shift in the perception of legitimacy of womens college basketball since men became a bigger part of the audience and became more vocal about it. It seems almost as though men beginning to take interest in it validated it and legitimized it as a sport. This is an issue with society, not men.",

While I agree that Jewish folks popularised what we now know as Hollywood, i simply fail to understand why it's difficult to understand the in group bias and leg ups. People helping other people they perceive are from their own group is a tale as old as time. The Marwadis, the Parsis, the Jains all do it in the country where I am from and that's why they're successful( or rather more successful than the general population).\n\nyou observe the same in tech industry. Indians favor Indians, Nigerians favouring Nigerians et al because there's a sense of community.\n\nIn group bias causes a disproportionate representation, not some evil concocted plans of hate for others out groups.\n\nThe conflict I see in primarily the US society is precisely because of this lack of acknowledgement of in group bias. The minority groups want a bigger slice of the pie so they're willing to call out system the white folks created to support each other out of the in group biases. They see that as just and fair.\n\nBut the moment their own in group biases are called out, the labels of -isms and -ists come out in full force. \n\nthe majority group, in this case see it as a huge double standard and cracks in a structure are created that leads to further crevices.\n\nan example i would cite is Jeffrey Epstein. I won't talk of his crimes, i would cite his lack of credentials and his privilege as a member of Jewish community in New York that helped him climb those ranks.\n\nanother case can be made for the recent winner, Sean Combs or Diddy.\n\nBut if you criticise their privilege( before they were revealed as predators), you'd be called antisemitisic and racist.\n\nSome may argue that these rotten apples are used as examples to paint the larger communities as bad but the exact same thing is done to white people. \"Yt or Wypipo bad, Wypipo evil\" has been echoed so much in last few years that the same argument of \"painting everyone with a broad stroke can be used\".\n\n",

        "author": "Mysterious-Law-60",
        "selftext": "I am giving my experience from US. I am not saying this is going to happen in the next year or even 10 years but maybe in 30 years or so, most developed countries could go completely cashless. For developing countries, it will obviously take much much longer maybe even 100 years because of the technological advancements they would require.\n\nThere are several issues with cash that are not present with the banking system. Cash transactions are on average slower than digital transactions. The government and companies that handle a lot of cash, spend a lot of money to print cash or transport physical cash. The Federal Reserve Banks spend about 750million every year in handling cash and a lot of businesses require about 4-5% of their revenue in handling cash and ensuring its security. Crime - physical cash can not be tracked effectively and criminals are able to take advantage of this to fund any illegal operations using money laundering. Criminals are also more likely to rob stores that use cash as it is very easy for them to steal and use. With digital transactions, the general process for criminals to steal will be much harder.\n\nAlso according to this report by fdic, 4.5% of households in US did not have any banking system. (https://www.fdic.gov/household-survey) So the general infrastructure which would need to be added for every individual to have a debit card with them is not a lot and we have the general resources to do that.\n\nThe key concern I expect from people is privacy. I understand the importance of privacy and your concerns are valid. However there is a tradeoff between privacy and convenience. Most people who own mobile phones or social media apps have accepted the tradeoff that the convenience which a mobile phone is valid to trade the privacy like the government or mobile phone company could track your location or other information about you. Similar to the mobile phone government situations the laws with respect to government accessing an individuals banking information would also be created as we move more towards a cashless society.\n\nAnother argument is that there are relatively simple every day situations like a lemonade stand. I believe these will also become cashless and children can accept payment using some of the alternatives which already exist. Like Venmo, Square, PayPal. A lot of technology with respect to going cashless already exists and it would be relatively doable to go forward with.\n\nLastly I do accept that there are many risks with going to a completely cashless economy like the data privacy issue and even the problems which might occur in case of lack of electricity or technological problems. There will also be more cybercrime and attacks on banking systems by criminals with this approach. But the amount of illegal activities would be easier to track with this system and the reduced cost and convenience with respect to handling digital transactions is the main reason I believe it will occur and would be a good change\n\nAlso just stating but as an individual in US, when I go out for anything. I don't carry cash with me. Because I don't need it and have not needed it at any point in the recent past\n\n",

        "title": "CMV: manufacturing jobs are not \"good jobs\".",
        "author": "Nillavuh",
        "selftext": "A quick disclaimer: I worked IN factories for 14 years as a manufacturing engineer (I no longer do as of 2021). I was never a production-line employee myself, but I met all sorts of them over my 14 years in that career field, from some of the largest companies in the world to some of the smallest.\n\nSimply put, when I hear anyone refer to a manufacturing job as a \"good job\", I just straight-up do not agree with them, for a number of reasons.\n\nFirst and foremost: there are few, if any, more soul-crushing means of employment than a job in manufacturing. In about 1-2 hours, you will be taught how to do your job, and you will then do this monotonous and unchallenging work, every day, 8 hours at a time, for something like the next 40 years of your life. Attach bolt to this hole, attach label to this location, snap piece A into piece B, and do those things over and over and over again, for an absolutely interminable amount of time. I'm telling you I know of few better ways to crush a person's soul than to ensure that the majority of their daily life force is spent on such monotonous work. I once watched a video of manufacturing employees in China who spent 12 hours at a time sorting socks, and to this day I consider it one of the most haunting and depressing things I've ever seen. Because that's practically worse than death: being forced to stay alive and endure monotony, endlessly, for decades at a time. It's horrific.\n\nIn my experience, there are three types of employees at these jobs: 1) the person who is saving up some money to go to school and get themselves a job that will NOT crush their souls and is thus working there temporarily 2) the person who truly, genuinely enjoys their work (this is a very small percentage of employees) 3) the people who are just completely dead inside, clearly considerably less full of life and vivacity than they likely were when they started and are now just hollow shells of who they used to be (this is absolutely the most significant portion of employees). And this is what we actually want people to become...\n\nSecond, this \"career path\" clearly has no future whatsoever. It is largely dependent on politicians pulling some odd strings to try and recreate jobs that are obviously being replaced by automation and AI and the realities of the global economy which is outside of any one country's control, so even if you have a job today, your chances of still having that job 5 years from now are drying up REAL fast. And depending on who gets elected and what their priorities are, they could dry up even faster. So what is so great about a job with no future?\n\nThird, simply put, there are just too many other viable options for employment out there. Nobody should be thinking about manufacturing jobs in a vacuum; they should only ever think about them in the context of other jobs one could get instead. What does it matter if you think a manufacturing job pays well if there are other jobs out there that also pay well, AND don't crush your soul at the same time? It has long been known that automation [creates more jobs than it destroys](https://fee.org/articles/automation-replaced-800-000-workers-then-it-created-35-million-new-jobs/) (and honestly, if you didn't know this at this point, what the fuck have you been doing as a purportedly politically engaged person?), it's just that the catch is that those new jobs will require more education than previous jobs (which, BTW, is a great reason to support education in any way possible, but that's another topic for another day). So if we ride the wave of automation correctly, like we ought to, we eventually arrive at a place where we have a more educated workforce, doing more skilled labor *that will absolutely lead to higher wages to compensate,* and people don't even need to do soul-crushingly dull work either! They will have variety and challenge and not have their souls destroyed. What's not to like about that?\n\nRather than embracing some return to unskilled manufacturing jobs, we should instead push for education and filling more skilled roles that will ultimately leave people in a better place.

Anything that has something that we have never seen before. \n\nWe are now in an era of superheroes, remakes, reboots and generic action, horror, sci fi etc films. There dosen't seem to be anything new that can have the cultural staying power and the impact it would have in popculture. We are know getting a repeated release of superhero films that are basically all the same. \n\nWe are getting a lot of generic action, horror and sci fi films that also do the same thing that we have seen before. \n\nThere isn't anything new or original. Take for example the xenomorph from the alien franchise. It was one of the most memorable and original alien designs ever brought to film. It also has very interesting characteristic features and life cycle that is forever remembered. The exact same thing applies to the predator ( replace life cycle with culture) \n\nWhen was the last time we have ever seen a creature that is as memorable as the xenomorph or the predator? \n\nWas there a movie or series that had an original concept like the matrix did? \n\nPersonally i don't know all i have seen are generic repeated superhero films or generic movies with the same old tropes. \n\nNow this could most likely be from me not knowing any such movies or shows out there. \n\nSo i was hoping if someone could change my view on this topic",

But now that this has happened, I am now convinced that both my description of covert racism in policy AND systemic racism against black people are occurring today in the US.\n\nFor context, I am white, and my mind could be changed on this issue in either direction honestly (more in the affirmative or in the negative). But clear examples would need to be given to demonstrate that systemic racism doesn't exist, or that it isn't to the extent that I am about to highlight, or perhaps that it's actually even worse than what I am describing and goes much deeper.\n\nRacism is defined as \"[prejudice](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=f207507d3efe929e&sca_upv=1&rlz=1C1NDCM_enUS960US960&sxsrf=ADLYWIJ94fLAPNJxLXytL4e5Ltfj_Ddhrw:1727748350188&q=prejudice&si=ACC90nxMSPeZfdJJjQgDsdZJuFuJBLaAZDmFi3fOmMVPu9W4F0iu1ifPjjHBNAucituW_Sqidu1lPTmczyygkMq5ds0Q7fTsSaA0rWqtzKmPXbrxE3jjyuE%3D&expnd=1&sa=X&sqi=2&ved=2ahUKEwjGkbKVjOyIAxXql4kEHf5pMSIQyecJegQIGxAO), discrimination, or\u00a0[antagonism](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=f207507d3efe929e&sca_upv=1&rlz=1C1NDCM_enUS960US960&sxsrf=ADLYWIJ94fLAPNJxLXytL4e5Ltfj_Ddhrw:1727748350188&q=antagonism&si=ACC90nz-2feRzoY4yuySkO-aQE81UCMZ74J16NF8-_SMaDcwRUT6yIn7SGAYb4v0HTLfBfon3OCa1hTSoCRemmbQFv7gwdW4pFaaN6ybukokgEwa6qkira8%3D&expnd=1&sa=X&sqi=2&ved=2ahUKEwjGkbKVjOyIAxXql4kEHf5pMSIQyecJegQIGxAP)\u00a0by an individual, community, or institution against a person or people on the basis of their membership in a particular racial or ethnic group, typically one that is a minority or\u00a0[marginalized](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=f207507d3efe929e&sca_upv=1&rlz=1C1NDCM_enUS960US960&sxsrf=ADLYWIJ94fLAPNJxLXytL4e5Ltfj_Ddhrw:1727748350188&q=marginalized&si=ACC90nxkzgN-KbLuTWKT81WCi4_nHzO5xzR0FIPnVc5BPXde0pMbD5W5log7abqaz5ljUsg69UgAZXZ30acSbhfYGJDG7XIFjE8mOm207p2XjskYdPj07nY%3D&expnd=1&sa=X&sqi=2&ved=2ahUKEwjGkbKVjOyIAxXql4kEHf5pMSIQyecJegQIGxAQ).\"\n\nSystemic racism would essentially be institutionalized racism that is enacted on a systemic level. So if there is a CEO or owner of a business that is vehemently racist towards black people, they can implement their racism into policy and/or actions that they take towards black employees at work but they can always cover it up as something other than racism.\n\nFor example, the owner does all the hiring/firing for the business. If they see a name or a picture that suggests this is a black applicant, they will immediately throw their resume in the trash and email them a very vague and broad response such as \"We have decided to move forward with other candidates at this time. Thank you for your application.\" If a lot of these racist individuals have worked their way up to the top like that owner has, and they also own/manage businesses, then this kind of latent racism has now become systemic, because no matter how qualified and experienced these black applicants are, they'll always be rejected by these businesses just based on the color of their skin. And the businesses will always provide some other, arbitrary reason for why they didn't hire the black applicant. This actually impacts black people on a systemic level because it means they will be less likely to get jobs no matter how qualified they are, even compared to their unqualified white peers.\n\nThese types of latent racist policies can exist in schools, allowing certain kids to take classes or honors programs while precluding others. They can exist in realty and leasing: I actually had a white realtor tell me once, \"I'm not racist, but I'd never rent to a black person. They're just too destructive and unpredictable,\" and since this wasn't in writing, there was no way for me to prove that she said this. These racist policies can be implemented in as many ways as there are jobs and services, because a racist white supremacist could be at the top, making all the calls, denying opportunities to black people and then lying and saying \"it's not because of their skin, it's for x, y, and z reasons.\"\n\nEssentially, systemic racism exists because racist people exist, and those racist people can work their way up to the top of government, businesses, services, etc. to make sure their racism is implemented very covertly in policy so that no one catches them. But it is wide-reaching and has negative impacts on non-white individuals, namely black people.",

That anything that can be AI generated will be. \n\nWe\u2019ve heard about scripts, generated graphics, and various other aspects, but at the end of the day, it\u2019s my feeling that while there may be an explosion and over saturation of artists, there won\u2019t be nearly as much of a market for the AI generated content as we are being lead to believe. \n\nWe can look at cases like Tyler Perry canceling plans to build a large scale studio, however, I think this might be a bit of an overreaction;\n\nComics is a great example where we have not seen an attempt to sell AI generated comic content and I have yet to see any appetite for this kind of content despite it already being completely possible to create comics nearly from scratch to completion using current AI tools. Comic enthusiasts who are the backbone of that industry are still very interested in who is crafting the stories, and who is actually drawing them. \n\nMusic similarly can be created by AI, but I can\u2019t imagine a world where the only songs that we stream are not connected to an artist for which their skill as a performer or their ability to produce the music itself. Music has constantly gotten easier and easier to produce but given this, it is still quite difficult to actually become a professional musician, and the tools have not replaced the talent it takes to use those tools. \n\nMy point is that AI may function as a tool, but I think our taste as a society will serve as a sort of check on the idea of content getting out of control. The interim period between when large content producing companies begin to realize this, will be a bloodbath for creators on the industry, but I suspect the people who are really passionate will stick around and will ultimately become the new center of content creators. \n\n",

If you feel you've made a good point that I've passed over, feel free to reiterate it and I'll give it a second look.**\n\nTried to keep the thread title concise, but there are a few layers to this CMV.  I'll just bullet point them to make things easy.\n\n* This is referring to being in a relationship with a man with the intent being that it progress to marriage or something that looks a lot like marriage.\n\n* This view is a generality, not an \"all women\" or \"all men\" view.  The biggest exception will be women who just generally prefer the company of men to the company of women.  Part of this view is that that group of women is a significant minority (less than 20% of women if you want to put a number on it).\n\n* Women who are just looking to share their lives, their hopes, their dreams and their ambitions with someone who will stand besides her and support her can find that in their friendships with other women, and\n\n* Those relationships with other women come with less of a perceived \"burden\" than a relationship with a man does.  Most women today see living with a man and sharing a life with a man as a balance between \"what can I tolerate\" and \"how much does he add to my life\".  Without that financial support, there is very little to balance out the toleration.  And her relationships with other women require a far lesser amount of perceived toleration or burden.\n\n* An exception that is part of my view is a woman who is looking for an exact reversal of traditional gender roles.  If she's looking for someone to care for her children while she works and financially supports the family, finding a man who wants that lifestyle would be a better source than utilizing other relationships in her life (like parents or other family members).\n\n* A lot of women still seek out relationships with men, but my view is that many of them are doing that simply because \"that's what she's supposed to do\".  If you really put her on the spot and asked her to explain why it was important to her to have a man in her life she'd be stumped to come up with an answer (that doesn't boil down to some form of finances).",

        "selftext": "EDIT: Required in highschool\n\nFor starters, the political compass is relatively simple in concept and even if you go into the specific ideals and what they entail, it doesnt take that long to learn, so it wouldn't need an entire class dedicated to it.\n\nThe reason I think this needs to be done is most people that argue about politics don't seem to undedstand that the difference between left and right is unrelated to the difference between authoritarian and libertarian. Many automatically assume that the other side is authoritarian (which is often seen as bad) because they don't understand how politics work.\n\nOn top of that, understanding that it is a spectrum is also important and many don't see it this way. Alot of people I've talked to about politics assume that if you are right you are a fascist and if you are left you are a communist (typically when they are in the other side by the way), but in reality these are both the ultra authoritarian sides of the spectrum. This is what Stalin and Hitler had in common, and the fact that most find it suprising or baffling that Hitler and Stalin had a peace treaty, when this shouldn't be suprising at all knowing they are both ultra authoritarian.\n\nOn top of that, understanding politics fundamentally will encourage people to vote better, rather than just who's on their 'side'.\n\nNow, I already see 3 problems with this, the first being it would have to be tought purely objectively.\n\nThe 2nd problem is logistics. How would you asure its unbiased? Who would determine if it is biased or unbiased? What class should it fall under? Etc. These would take time and experimentation to figure out.\n\nThe 3rd problem is the fact that the political compass has a major flaw, being that the left-right spectrum is both social and economical, but if you leave social out you still get a fair representation of politics and then you can teach the social spectrum as its own thing.\n",

        "selftext": "I promise this isn't a troll post, and I'll be able to sum up my reasoning pretty quickly. So for those unaware, following the \"Hawk Tuah\" clip becoming famous online, the girl involved (Hailey Welch) started a podcast called Talk Tuah which is currently the third most popular podcast on Spotify. I love this.\n\nFirst off, props to Hailey Welch for capitalizing on a seemingly meaningless fifteen minutes of fame type thing, I thought the clip was kinda funny, but I would've forgotten about it instantly had it not become a podcast. For some reason she became famous and she's riding the wave, props. But that's not the main purpose of this post, or my love for Hawk Tuah.\n\nI love Hawk Tuah because its exposed a lot of people for being unnecessarily bitter, bitter towards the world very broadly speaking. I don't want to get too anecdotal, but the amount of people who get so mad about something this stupid gaining online fame is really hilarious, and forgetting Hawk Tuah for a second, there are so many people who just have a lot of hatred in their hearts for the 21st century world. They hate the existence of social media, they think that people enjoying random memes somehow equates to the complete degeneracy of Western society.\n\nTo be honest, I get some peoples' concerns about being addicted to social media, but any \"addiction\" that isn't chemical is a choice, people have free will and if they want to waste away their whole lives on Instagram, X, Tiktok, or god forbid Reddit (lol), they're free to do that. But there exists a happy medium between being chronically online and time travelling to before 1995, and I think that medium is the ideal world. I think that largely due to introduction of rapid global connectivity we live in what is by far the best part of human existence that has yet come to pass.\n\nI'm ranting, so I'll try and condense all that into a TL;DR, a random meme has quickly resulted in the creation of online fame, there's a lot of people that spend a lot of time utterly hating that fact, and I'm glad they're being exposed for what they are. We live in the best time in human history, the existence of memes to laugh at doesn't hinder humanity in any way.",

Needless to say, the fact that he withdrew from the race confirmed my belief that he was a weak candidate and would have lost against Donald Trump. And for a while-- up until early September-- I saw Kamala Harris as a much stronger candidate with a better chance of winning than Biden ever had. However, I now have extreme doubts that Harris is going to win, for a number of reasons listed below.\n\n1.  Despite being allegedly more popular than Biden, Harris is polling within the margin of error of Biden in all of the swing states. Even a small polling error, which there is almost certain to be, would put Trump over the edge enough to win.\n2. Harris is losing support compared to Biden in \"sun belt\" states such as Arizona and Georgia, meaning that any victory she does achieve would be much narrower than Biden's, with fewer backup options.\n3. There are rumors of an upcoming Israeli offensive in Lebanon in the coming weeks, and if that happens, it could cause American public opinion to swing strongly against the Biden administration, and by extension Harris. \n4. The leader of a dock-worker's union in New York has announced his intention to go on strike in October, potentially sending the American economy into a tailspin and once again damaging the Biden administration's image at a crucial time.

        "title": "CMV: Comedy and Battle Rap Should Have No Restrictions on Speech",
        "author": "Empty_Alternative859",
        "selftext": "\nI believe that in spaces like comedy and battle rap, there should be complete freedom of speech with no restrictions, even on sensitive topics. I see a lot of criticism in video essays and discussions where comedians are called out for making insensitive jokes, and people seem to agree with these critiques. As someone who has followed battle rap for a long time, I\u2019ve seen battle rappers use subjects like race, personal issues (e.g., addiction), and even deceased family members. In most cases, fans and performers understand that these battles are part of a show, and the exaggerated and offensive content is meant to entertain, not to cause real harm.\n\nWhile I personally don\u2019t find many racist or insensitive jokes funny, I think there should be protected spaces where these kinds of jokes or battle lines can be made without censorship. If you're participating or watching these kinds of performances, you should know what you're signing up for. The shock factor is part of the appeal, and restricting it might make these art forms lose their edge.\n\nHere\u2019s why I think this:\n\n1. Artistic Freedom: Comedy and battle rap are about pushing boundaries. Whether it's making people uncomfortable or provoking thought, these art forms thrive on challenging societal norms. If we start restricting speech, we risk watering down the creativity that makes these performances unique and impactful.\n\n\n2. Context is Key: The context of a joke or a battle matters. Most people attending a comedy show or a battle rap event understand that the content is not meant to be taken literally. In this environment, offensive language or themes are understood as part of the act, similar to how viewers understand that violence in movies isn\u2019t real.\n\n\n3. Opt-In Participation: People choose to attend these events or watch these performances. If they know ahead of time that offensive or controversial material might come up, they can decide whether or not they want to engage. It\u2019s a choice, and people can opt out if it\u2019s not for them.\n\nHowever, I\u2019m willing to have my view changed. Here are some points where I could see counterarguments:\n\n1. Harm to Vulnerable Groups: Even in a performance setting, racist jokes or references to personal trauma can reinforce harmful stereotypes. While the performers and fans might understand that it\u2019s \"just a show,\" the normalization of these types of speech can extend beyond the event and harm people in the real world.\n\n2. Social Responsibility: Public figures, whether they are comedians or battle rappers, have influence. The words and ideas shared in these settings can shape public perception and discourse. If we allow unrestricted speech in these arenas, are we also inadvertently normalizing harmful speech or creating an environment where certain offensive ideas become socially acceptable?\n\nI understand that my view might be flawed, especially if the unrestricted speech has the potential to cause real-world harm. But in the context of performance art, I believe there is a valid case for allowing complete freedom of expression.\n\nSo, CMV: Should comedy and battle rap have unrestricted speech, or are there valid reasons to introduce limits?\n\n",

        "author": "Grand-Tension8668",
        "selftext": "It goes without saying that I have no idea what the hell I'm talking about and am speaking as an outside observer. This is one of those situations, though, where I can't help but think that I'm looking at a profession and industry that is totally \"lost in the sauce\" and in need of a reality check. **Not** by me, obviously, by people with a far greater understanding of market economies and how to work within them (and a drive to understand how the mental health industry functions at a high level, lobbyists, insurance agencies, etc.)\n\nHere's what I know:  \n\n- People in this profession are *beat*. Like... [crisis-level](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3156844/) burnout for 30%+ of these professionals. Obviously Reddit is a sample group that inevitably skews negagive to a significant degree, but social workers and therapists seem particularly fatalistic about the stress of their jobs, and not just because of the pay, but also because of unsustainable case loads.   \n\n- This is not an industry where a high profit margin can be expected. It just isn't. There are no goods being produced. It's difficult to prove to insurance agencies that something substantial is being accomplished and even if you can, you need to convince federal and state governments that investing in this profession would lead to a significant return on investment, and that clearly isn't happening.  \n\n- This is a profession in which a *masters* degree is expected as a rule- six-plus years of academic schooling (and we all know how much that costs), followed by several *years* of supervised clinical work which amounts to barely-paid internships for buisnesses to exploit   \n\n- That supervised clinical work is neccesarily because, big shock, classroom studies don't guarentee that someone is cut out for such a subjective, soft-skills focused profession  \n\n- On the flipside, preparing people *for* and judging people on their performance *in* such a profession is pretty nebulous, and there are enough horror stories of \"psychotic\" clinical supervisors that it has been [discussed in journals](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07325223.2017.1297753)  \n\nWhat I *think*, which is all essentially unfounded ancedotal gut feeling:  \n\n- It seems pretty fundamental and obvious to me that the cost of entering into these professions outweighs the return to an absurd degree. **They will** ***not*** **start paying more, because the fundamental issue is the willingness and ability of others to pay, and that won't budge.** This, I think, is the real heart of this CMV.  \n\n- Despite the huge effort at filtering out individuals with no buisness working in the field, ancedotally it seems clear that they end up working in the field all the same. Instead of accompilshing the goal of finding good psychologists, therapists, social workers, etc., the industry finds highly driven individuals who will either give everything up for the job or have the assets and mindset for academia / management-tier positions. \n\n- Academia leads to sunk-cost fallacy, inflated egos, and attracts psychopaths in the same manner that high-level corporate positions do. The end-result is an industry that convinces itself that this degree of \"earning your keep\" is perfectly rational because everyone else had to do it, it must surely be accomplishing it's goals, and because it grants pleasure to those in a position to lord over entire professions. (See also the much-discussed, hopefully overblown replication crisis.)  \n\n- Crucially, any industry with a burnout problem has a chicken-or-the-egg question on their hands. Nowhere near enough workers, and those who enter leave fast because they're expected to pick up the slack. The only way out is a rapid influx of extra bodies to balance out working conditions. ",

Its sort of like an extrapolation (or perversion to some) of the Martin Luther King Jr. quote \"an injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere\". Funny enough, Arthur Miller (author of The Crucible) said \"Perhaps because there are those who believe that authority is all of a piece and that to challenge it anywhere is to threaten it everywhere\" years earlier than MLK's Letters from Birmingham Jail.\n\nThe typical impression of vigilante justice is the anarchist perspective, taking the law into one's own hand, breaking unjust laws because the system is unjust, and vigilante justice is superior to administrative injustice. Whether it is the extrajudicial killing of a pedophile or other pariahs (someone who had sex out of wedlock in many non-secular nations), or the stealing of food, money, and other things to survive poverty, many examples can be brought up.\n\nThe opposite direction exists too, the authoritarian perspective: enforcing laws that were not on the books to begin with, e.g. that series of incidents where various gun control groups were encouraging the swatting of open carry civilians even in states where it is perfectly legal in most circumstances, those anti ebike karens who insist that class 1-3 electric bicycles are \"motor vehicles\" even though all 50 states DMVs have stated otherwise, and it is utmost concerning when people in power try to justify it by simply changing the definition (e.g. ATF arbitrarily saying Forced Reset Triggers are machine guns even though the NFA statues literally says \"...single function of the trigger\", which the Forced Reset Trigger requires multiple functions)\n\nThe consequences of anarchist vigilante justice are confined to the actions of an individual and their close followers' victims, the consequences of authoritarian vigilante justice affect an entire jurisdiction.

        "author": "2252_observations",
        "selftext": "Universities in Australia have been deeply concerned since [a cap on international students was announced last month](https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/foreign-students-capped-at-270-000-in-blow-for-large-universities-20240827-p5k5o9.html). The cap was intended to appease political pressure to cut immigration to alleviate the housing shortage. However, the article linked above shows that higher education experts foresee that this would not entice international students to go to less famous universities in cities where the housing shortage is less dire, it would instead dissuade them from studying in Australia altogether.\n\n[Australia scores very poorly in terms of innovation](https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/australia-s-dud-report-card-on-innovation-and-entrepreneurship-20230621-p5digj), even though [innovation is necessary for diversifying our economy](https://theconversation.com/for-a-future-made-in-australia-we-need-more-innovation-and-diverse-people-in-science-and-tech-229717). This poor innovation score is despite being [#21 in terms of R&D spending as a percentage of GDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states_by_research_and_development_spending) - which is higher than Hong Kong, Ireland, New Zealand, Estonia and Canada. So perhaps this might imply that Australia is inefficient with the money spent on R&D.\n\nWhile the cut in foreign students might mean that local students can try to fill in the gap, there's only so much locals can do. [I myself tried to do a PhD here as a domestic student and I failed](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b9m15p/cmv_i_find_it_unfair_that_society_values_the/). The reason I bring this up is to show that unless the majority of Australians are capable of producing more and better research than I am, then it means we lack the local innovation talent to address this problem - I myself am a part of that problem.\n\nI had very supportive supervisors BTW, and I still blew it. Perhaps I really am among the dumber half of Australians. But I don't think I'll be ever able to help address the lack of innovation, and as my failed attempt at a PhD shows, I am far from being able to successfully contribute to STEM. It will be a real struggle for Australia to address its lack of innovation unless it can somehow import foreign students while addressing any toothing problems (like the housing shortage) or turn more Australian citizens into successful domestic PhD students.\n\nOn an anecdotal note, I would say that this phenomenon is partly due to widespread disdain of academia in Australia:\n\n* For example, one of the most famous Australians ever is Steve Irwin. While he did help conservation and research, our society bestowed him with fame and fortune instead of giving it to academics who've contributed even more to furthering knowledge of animal science.\n* Disdain of academia permeates society to the point that it influences voting decisions. In a recent referendum we had in Australia,\u00a0[one of the Vote No arguments was that academia tended to support it and people did not trust academia](https://www.skynews.com.au/australia-news/we-want-to-speak-for-ourselves-aboriginal-man-interrupts-anthony-albanese-during-discussion-on-the-voice-at-bush-summit/news-story/a067de8b3b69331888273945c38a636e).\n* Regarding the earlier point I made about spending on R&D, some PhD holders like Rachael Gunn have made themselves look so bad that [parliamentarians are questioning the use of taxpayer funds to pay for \"entitlement and frivolity in Australian academia\"](https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Hansard/Hansard_Display?bid=chamber/hansards/28055/&sid=0029). I am not in support of Rachael Gunn here, I am just pointing out that what she did has inflamed the disdain of academia.\n\nTherefore, I say that a nation's lack of innovation is actually a very stubborn problem - because it is proving impossible to fix despite generous R&D spending. **So to change my view:**\n\n* Show me a way that society can be quickly convinced to become supportive of academia instead of treating it with disdain.\n* Show me what a country can realistically do to squeeze out more innovation per unit of R&D spending.\n* Show me how local students can be made to produce enough innovation to fill the gap left by the cut in foreign students - and that encouraging more locals to attempt PhDs won't just result in more people failing their PhDs like I did.\n\nFinally, before you tell me \"*PhDs aren't equal to innovation*\", at the end of the day, PhD or no PhD, Australia as a nation is still scoring poorly in terms of innovation. And I think the points I brought up (R&D inefficiency, lack of local innovation talent, lack of public appreciation for academia) are probably not exclusive to Australia, but also occur in other nations struggling to be innovative too.",

        "title": "CMV: Porn is not a bad thing. Society is made better because of porn.",
        "author": "Keith502",
        "selftext": "It has come to my attention that there are many people who consider pornography to be bad for society.  In the US, some have even called for porn to be banned or heavily restricted by the government.  Personally, I have never understood this line of thought.  Not only do I think that porn is not bad for society, but I believe it is actually an overall good for society.\n\n**Obscenity**\n\nSome have criticized porn as being \"obscenity\".  I personally do not consider porn \"obscene\".  There are many things that I would call much more \"obscene\" than porn which society tends to tolerate.  Many TV shows and movies show depictions of graphic violence, drug use, tobacco use, alcohol use, gambling, etc.  Many movies depict and glorify things like organized crime and high-profile theft.  I don't know how exactly one would define \"obscene\", but I personally consider all of these depictions to be more \"obscene\" than porn.  Graphic violence is far more disturbing to me than simply watching people have consensual sex; and depictions of drug, tobacco, and alcohol use is clearly more damaging to one's health, and depictions of gambling is more damaging to one's financial well-being.  These other depictions are far more poisonous to an individual's moral character and well-being than porn could ever be.\n\nFurthermore, one reason why porn is not obscene is because of what it fundamentally is.  Porn is a depiction of consensual sexual intercourse.  Consensual sex between two adults is perfectly normal and natural.  Skillful and mutually pleasurable sex is beautiful -- perhaps the most beautiful thing in all of nature.   It is absurd to claim that a video recording of the most beautiful phenomenon in all of nature is inherently \"bad\" or \"obscene\".  Watching two people make love -- to squeeze every last drop of pleasure that they can conjure from each other's flesh -- is simply a superlatively beautiful and majestic thing.  It is utterly ridiculous to say that the exhibition of such an act is more obscene than a movie that depicts -- or even glorifies -- people getting beaten, shot, stabbed, blown up, burned alive, tortured, dismembered, raped, etc.  Porn is nothing more than the depiction of skillful sex; hence, not only does it not deserve to be demonized or banned, but it should be praised as a graceful form of art, like ballet.  It should be studied by lovers and married people; they can be inspired by it and learn from it in order to spice up their sex lives with more adventurous activities and positions.  Porn actors are just highly skilled, highly experienced professionals whose performances can be studied in order to enhance one's own sexual performance, just as, for example, studying an acclaimed athlete, artist, or entertainer could be used to develop one's own craft. \n\n**Objectifying women**\n\nSome people have claimed that porn exposure is correlated with the objectification or abuse of women.  In my understanding, this couldn't be further from the truth.  [Here ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/vlgtrg/pornography_laws_by_region/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) is a thread that provides a map of general pornography laws that exist in countries across the world (green means porn is legal, yellow means partially legal, red means completely illegal).  And [here ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/1bbg2ti/countries_that_are_safeunsafe_for_women/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) is a thread that includes a world map illustrating overall danger for women by country (the darker the color, the more violence and inequality towards women).  If you'll notice, there is a very interesting correlation: the countries that allow more access to porn tend to be safer for women; and the countries that are more restrictive towards porn generally tend to be more dangerous for women.  One particularly interesting fact is that Israel appears to be the only country in the Middle East that allows porn, and also appears to be one of the safest countries for women in the Middle East.  Also, Japan is one of the few countries in Asia that allows porn, and is also among the safest countries in Asia for women.  If porn led to sexual violence towards women, then you would see the opposite statistics.   \n\nThe availability of porn is indicative of a more sexually liberal society which is correlated with a society that is more civilized, and which treats women with more dignity.  Generally speaking, countries that ban porn tend to be countries that are more culturally backwards, the kinds of places that allow things like clitorectomies, concubinage, polygamy, child marriage, sexual slavery, beating and disfiguring of wives by husbands, and general deprivation of women's civil rights.  As one example, porn is banned in Egypt.  It so happens that Egypt has a notorious problem with sexual violence towards women (you might remember the infamous 2011 gang rape of the 60 Minutes reporter Lara Logan as she was reporting on events in the country).  In addition to Egypt, some other countries that have a rape problem are New Guinea and India, which both have banned porn. There is simply no clear correlation between the availableness of porn and sexual violence towards women; if anything, the correlation is the inverse, with countries with higher rates of sexual violence tending to be countries that ban porn.  The fact is, countries that allow porn to be viewed tend to treat women better than places that don't.  \n\nAlso, if nothing else, porn is a healthy venting of sexual lust.  Porn does not make people commit sexual violence; if anything it diffuses the kind of passions that lead to things like child molestation, rape, groping, voyeurism, etc.  If more libidinous men can vent their lust through porn, then fewer of them will vent their lust in a way that is more violent or intrusive.  Countries that are more sexually conservative, and which ban porn, force women to dress with extreme modesty, and prohibit fraternization between young men and women -- these countries lead to the existence of a sexually repressed and sexually frustrated society.  Such an emotionally repressed society can become an unstable powder keg of sexual violence, some examples of which I have provided above.  \n\nAlso, I believe that the consumption of porn actually reduces the incidence of people who will relieve their libido by engaging in reckless, promiscuous sex with strangers.  It so happens that in many ancient cultures, it was common for an unmarried man to relieve his libido through the patronage of prostitutes, as this was much more acceptable than the capital crime of adultery, or the taboo of fornicating with unmarried virgins.  One way that porn is good for society is that it is a safer alternative to the aforementioned measures.  If more men are relieving themselves to porn rather than engaging in reckless promiscuity or prostitution, then this will lead to less incidence of the spread of venereal diseases and unwanted pregnancies.  \n\n**Religion**\n\nSome people criticize porn from a religious perspective.  However, I see this as the height of hypocrisy.  I would actually argue that a religious text such as the Bible is actually more obscene and disturbing than pornography.  The Bible condones many things that society today would consider much more \u201cobscene\u201d or problematic to society, such as polygamy, concubinage, slavery, and even genocide, just to name a few.  \n\nHowever, there are aspects of the Bible that are harmful specifically in the context of sexual behavior, which is ironic considering that the Bible is often invoked as a paragon of sexual morality and sexual purity.  Exodus 21:7-11 condones the selling of one\u2019s own daughter into slavery, presumably to become a concubine, i.e. a slave wife.  Deuteronomy 21:10-14 condones the forcing of female captives of war into becoming wives for the conquering soldiers.  In Numbers 31:13-18, Moses commands the slaughter of unarmed, noncombatant prisoners of war -- including women and children -- after which the virgin girls are to be claimed by the soldiers as forced wives.  Deuteronomy 22:28-29 stipulates that if an unbetrothed virgin is raped, she is to marry the man who raped her.  The Bible never condemns the act of rape categorically.  In 2 Samuel 12:11-12, King David receives a prophecy from God that, as punishment for committing adultery against another man, David\u2019s own wives will sleep with another man; and in 2 Samuel 16:21-22, this prophecy is fulfilled, and David\u2019s concubines are raped by his own son.  So in this particular case, these women's bodies were used as mere pawns by God as part of their husbands' punishment.  In Genesis 19:6-8, a man casually offers his own daughters to be raped by a rape mob; and in Judges 19:22-30, another man offers his daughters to be raped by a rape mob, and another man throws his own concubine to the mob to be brutally raped in his stead.  \n\nIn the ancient culture of the Bible, women did not have bodily autonomy as they do today, and women were largely understood to be commodities who could be married away to a suitor at her father\u2019s whim, could be sold into slavery for money, and the rape of a woman was not considered to be a crime against the victim but against the woman\u2019s father or husband.  Consent was not categorically considered a requirement to use a woman\u2019s body; there were many contexts in which it was considered acceptable to marry a woman, or have sex with her, or produce offspring through her, and the woman\u2019s consent was considered irrelevant.   Nothing like any of this occurs or is condoned within any kind of legitimate porn industry.\n\n**Addiction**\n\nSome people think that porn is addictive.  Personally, I have been watching porn for decades and I have never found it addictive.  I'm not even sure what it means to be addicted to something that the human body has a natural proclivity for.  Sexual desire is natural; it is natural to want to have sex, and to be aroused by watching others having sex.  Conversely, there is nothing natural about having a constant desire to smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol or snort cocaine.  There is no such thing as a \u201cporn addiction\u201d; you cannot be \u201caddicted\u201d to a natural desire, you can only at most have an \u201cundisciplined attitude\u201d toward a natural desire.  \n\nFurthermore, porn is not addictive because porn is merely an exhibition of sex, and sex is beautiful.  For example, I listen to music all the time, but I wouldn't say that I am addicted to music; I listen to it because it is beautiful to listen to and emotionally moving.  If I watch porn on a regular basis, that doesn't mean I am addicted to porn; it just means I enjoy appreciating things that are beautiful and emotionally moving.\n\nAnd even if I were to grant that porn can somehow be an \"addiction\", it would have to be one of the least deadly, least dangerous, least unhealthy, least socially disruptive, least financially costly of all addictions.  Far more problematic addictions include things like alcohol addiction, smoking addiction, drug addiction, gambling addiction, etc.  Even a \u201csex addiction\u201d is more destructive because of the chances of contracting STDs.  I would dare say that, inasmuch as porn is an \u201caddiction\u201d, it is probably one of the most benign of all addictions in existence.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn summary, I strongly disagree with public commentators who claim that porn is some kind of obscenity, or a stain on society, or a detriment to society\u2019s morals.   The above are my reasons for why pornography is not bad; and not only is it not bad, but society is actually made better because of the availability of porn, and in fact the availability of porn is itself a symptom of a healthy and civilized society.  How am I wrong about this?",

        "selftext": "Kamala Harris is currently outpacing Trump in many key battleground polls, which is impressive given the challenging landscape she faced when entering the race, especially right after Biden stepped down. She\u2019s rightly focusing on important issues like reproductive rights, immigrant protections, and LGBTQ+ rights, all of which are crucial to her campaign's success.\n\nHowever, as a young, white male, I feel there's a significant gap in her messaging. It seems to me that she's not directly addressing issues that affect voters like myself. To be clear, I\u2019m not trying to downplay the importance of her focus on female, LGBTQ+, and immigrant rights \u2013 those are all essential. But as someone who is about to vote for the first time, I feel somewhat alienated because issues that pertain to young, white men haven\u2019t been highlighted.\n\nMy view is also built off of seeing that recent trends are showing young white males increasingly turning to conservative candidates. This shift could be mitigated if progressive candidates like Harris addressed some of the key issues that young men face today.\n\nEdit: Here are some rights that, at the very least, are important to me that I'd like to see addressed by Kamala\n\n* Theres a large education gap among young men v women\n* Men are less likely to receive custody of their children in a custody battle. And are also more likely to pay more in child support than the mother would have to.\n* Violent crime against men by women is taken less seriously in the justice system and women often times get lesser sentences than men do for the same crime.\n\nA few things to note:\n\n* I generally align with the Democratic Party and am going to vote for Harris in the election.\n* I haven\u2019t watched every rally or speech, so if someone can point me to a moment where she has addressed the concerns of young, white male voters directly, I\u2019d be open to changing my view.\n* This is once again, not an attack on women or any minority group. I appreciate all the work that Harris has done on representing their needs, I just wish also that she would point out the needs of young white male voters.\n\n  \n**Final Edit:**  \nAlright I give up. Unfortunately my post caused a lot of male hate which is not really what I wanted when trying to have this conversation but I did come to a consensus. Harris should be campaigning for mens rights, but doing so would most likely damage her campaign currently and cause her to lose more than gain. I hope that in the future, this is different but as it stands currently, it isnt.

There are three main reasons for this concern.\n\nFirst, all the easiest scientific progress has already been made. It is getting harder and harder to think of new or groundbreaking ideas that haven\u2019t already been thought of and explored. There may be a critical mass of research such that new scientists spend their entire careers informing themselves of what\u2019s already been tried in any avenue of research, or even of which avenues of research exist in the first place.\n\nSecond, the economic law of diminishing returns is not going anywhere. Scientific progress is getting a lot more expensive, and the returns may eventually prove not to be worth the investment.\n\nThird, we may think of AI as a silver bullet, but even they are not immune to the first two concerns. If their intelligence outpaces ours, there will still need to be expensive hardware innovations to keep up. There may well come a time that AI are truly thinking of all the original ideas, but how will they be peer reviewed? How will anyone be able to figure out that they aren\u2019t just talking out of their asses like what Chat GPT does? Once again the law of diminishing returns is poised to rear its ugly head, assuming we even understand the prospective tests.\n\nIf we are heading toward scientific stagnation, certain problems could remain frustratingly out of reach indefinitely, and that could be very bad for us as a species.

        "selftext": "Despite the arguments Israel repeatedly makes, I do not believe there is any ground to believe that the UN and its related organizations are on **any objective and systemic level**, antisemitic.\n\nWords such as \"The Hague will not stop us\", uttered by Israel's prime minister, do not echo as a resounding declaration of justice-at-any cost, it just displays that Israel views itself utterly above any and all laws, even at the highest level, disregarding any criticism as antisemitism.\n\nI believe the entire attitude of anti-UN-ism that Israelis display stems from being fed state propaganda all their lives, considering they might as well be living under a state of constant war. They seem to be taught that any conflict in the region stems not from broader and more complex political reasons, rather their neighbors just hate Jews and their liberal democratic state *(ala Bush telling Americans 9/11 happened because the Muslims hated American freedoms. And note, I do not completely disregard that there IS often antisemitic sentiment shared among Israel's opposition, it's just that its far from the prime driving motivator of their actions, just as its unfair to say that islamophobia and ethnic hatred is Israels chief motive for its actions.)*   \n  \nSo, with their lives constantly endangered by their neighbors, they see any actions they take as just self-defense, and so when UN resolutions are leveled against them, they cannot logically compute that there might be a possibility that their government did something wrong, simply that the opposition is antisemitic.\n\nAnother argument made is that Israel faces disproportional scrutiny by the UN, when there are worse states floating around that get less flak. And Israel being the only Jewish state dictates that the UN is an antisemitic organization. Which I would once again refute and say that UN has yet to exercise any of its power against Israel, a fact Israelis much gloat about to demonstrate the impotency of it. Even now as the UN proposes an arms embargo to Israel and as Israel stands accused of genocide at the ICJ, the only commentary from Israelis is \"The US will veto it\" without any consideration to why this is in motion (Its of course common knowledge the UN is actually Hamas)\n\nAnd to add another point to that, what countries DO actually face international repercussions and sanctions? None other than Israeli rivals such as Iran, Syria and Lebanon.\n\nAnother final notion is that Israel, being the one state where Jews feel safe, is under attack by these international organizations- even if Israel is doing wrong, it is only doing so to ensure that Jews feel safe and have a country where they are free from repression, thus efforts to undermine it are antisemitic. But this too i consider false. Without making this a gotcha argument, consider that in the wake of the recent conflict, and any time there is a major stirrup in the region, a large number of Israelis up and leave the country, because there ARE other nations where jews can live without feeling discriminated and endangered.\n\nThis is precisely why whenever a Jew declares themselves non-Zionist or join an anti-Israel protest, they are met with the utmost scorn by Israelis and Zionists, because it immediately shatters the illusion that Israel is a necessary evil to protect Jews, because here is a Jew who feels completely safe in a country other than Israel and in fact considers Israel evil. These individuals are always degraded and attacked on every level because they demonstrate without a doubt, the lack of need for a 'Jewish homeland', and that opposition to Israel is not inherently antisemitic.",

While I respect this opinion, I believe that mandatory voting is a crucial step toward achieving a more representative and functional democracy. Here\u2019s why I think it should be implemented, and I invite others to change my view.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s address the core issue: voter apathy. In recent elections, we\u2019ve seen turnout rates that often hover around 50% in the U.S., with certain demographics\u2014particularly young people and marginalized communities\u2014showing even lower participation. This leaves a significant portion of the population unrepresented in decision-making processes that affect their lives. By making voting mandatory, we can ensure that all voices are heard, leading to policies that reflect the true will of the people rather than the preferences of a motivated minority.\n\nAlso, mandatory voting can mitigate the influence of money in politics. Politicians tend to cater to the interests of those who vote consistently, often neglecting the issues that matter to those who abstain. If everyone is required to vote, candidates would be compelled to address a broader array of concerns, rather than focusing on the narrow interests of a dedicated base. This could lead to more equitable and comprehensive policies, ultimately benefiting society as a whole.\nI would love to hear other views on this topic!",

        "title": "CMV: Music is objective.",
        "author": "DarkriseEQOA",
        "selftext": "I've been thinking about this topic recently because of Youtuber Become the Knight. He is a music channel and recently has been having livestreams of him discussing with his chat about whether music is objective or subjective. He thinks that it is indeed objective, but obviously it's hard to prove. He has about a 14-page rough draft Google doc that outlines his view. I will be referring to it a bit because he brings up a lot of good points that have convinced me that music is objective.\n\nFirst, it's important to understand the difference between personal taste and \"good\" music. We all have personal tastes in music that are influenced by a variety of different things. Taste is very subjective obviously. There is definitely a subjective experience to music for everyone, but I think there is absolutely an objective way to determine what music is actually good. Your personal taste doesn't necessarily mean that what you listen to is inherently good. Someone who thinks music is entirely subjective will argue that whatever they think is good, is at the end of the day, good, right? I would say this is just false. By this logic, some kid who has no clue how to make music, fiddling around on garage band can make music that has just as much merit as a composer who's devoted his life to music for decades. Simply because anyone can say they like the kid's music for whatever reason. What's the point of spending hundreds of hours trying to create the \"best\" music if none of it matters in the end? It's all up to the individuals subjective experience and therefore someone who has no clue how to properly make good music will make music that is just as meaningful as yours. That just sounds entirely wrong.\n\nBecome the Knight kind of sums up my first point from this quote. \"The \u201cmusic is subjective\u201d crowd would boil it down to \u201cthe music you like is good music.\u201d That\u2019s so embarrassingly intellectually lazy and cowardly, I will take the person who says it less seriously than before, at least in regards to music opinions. You can pretty much dismiss their opinions on music, because that\u2019s what they\u2019ve effectively done to yours. \u201cNo Mike! It\u2019s actually more inclusive! It means that everyone\u2019s opinion matters!\u201d No, it means that everyone\u2019s opinion is \u201cequally correct\u201d and therefore \u201cequally wrong.\u201d It really takes away any stakes of HAVING an opinion on music in the first place. No stakes means no meaning. It, imo, robs the meaning and identity of music appreciation. Why should we talk about WHY we like something if at the end of the day it doesn\u2019t matter?\"\n\nAnother great point Become the Knight brings up is talking about how some songs can commonly be agreed upon to be \"good\" by many people and this is important. \"Multiple anecdotes all pointing towards the same experience while listening to a song demonstrates a level of objectivity to me that transcends individual taste. A meaning and merit that goes deeper than one individual\u2019s thoughts or feelings on a piece of music. \" Now, if a bunch of people all collectively say that a particular song is good, does that mean it is OBJECTIVELY good? Not necessarily. But it's points us in the right direction when determining what good or bad music is.\n\nAn important aspect to music is its ability to elicit emotion. Our brains absolutely CAN distinguish \"music\" from just \"sound\" and we all know that music does elicit a lot of emotion. A piece of music that does a good job eliciting emotions in the listener is, in my opinion, objectively better than one that fails to do so in any way.\n\nSo with music being entirely objective, does that technically mean there's a #1 best piece of music ever created? If I'm arguing that music is objective, then, this is effectively what I'm saying, As crazy as it sounds, there very well could be an objective \"best song\". But it's completely impossible to measure to that extent.\n\nI absolutely understand that this is not at all the popular opinion when talking about objectivity or subjectivity in music. We have seemed to pretty much, as a society, accepted the fact that art is subjective and there's no two ways about it. But I do also think there could be a lot wrong with my stance, even though I'm convinced at this moment in time.\n\n  \nEDIT: Thanks for the responses. I am definitely still very conflicted on this one. It's very hard to argue that music is objective even though I think it's correct. I probably could've went into more detail specifically explaining what actually makes music objectively good but I definitely still need to do more research and brainstorm some more. My main point in all of this is that there's definitely objectivity in music that goes beyond anyone's personal taste. Maybe its isn't 100% undeniably objective, not sure.",

The problem is that many issues go mostly unnoticed but grow on kids into crippling issues once they become adults of their own.\n\nSecond, I want to stress the fact that I'm not thinking about some university or a citizenship exam, which are designed to be difficult and to test the limits of an individual capacity to learn and prepare, I'm thinking about a very simple exam that anyone with reasonable effort could easily pass, ~~about very basics of how children work biologically and psychologically~~ containing only scientifically proven facts about actions and their effects on children on average.  \nExamples could be:\n\n* Is it safe to leave a child unattended for X time in a locked car under the sun?\n* Does feeding soda to children under the age of 1 have any negative effect on their health?\n* Is it proven that hitting your child to teach them a lesson does not work?\n\nThird (added as an edit), I seem to need to specify that this is NOT about eugenics either, no one can prevent anyone from having children, the intent is solely to identify people that are proven to be unfit to be parents, which we currently don't do, and to incentivise education.\n\nAnd finally, no, I'm not stating that doing this would automatically solve all parenting problems out there, but I think it would make things a lot better. I'm talking about how every day I see people feeding sippy cups full of soda to their babies, or how children trip and bleed their month, go back crying to their parents who punish them by beating them more so they \"learn their lesson\". Parents that grant absolutely any wish to their child to the point where they are completely unable to control their Impulses and therefore be a working member of the society, and I could go on and on forever.\n\nAll these examples of course cannot be solved for people who do this with intention and purpose, but I do believe the vast majority of these mistakes happen because people simply don't know any better, and it didn't occur to them to check for reputable sources on what the best course of action in common situations should be.\n\nBy forcing people to take the exam and prove they did spend the time reading the (again, very minimal) material and were able to apply the concepts in the written test, would at least reduce the amount of troubled people that grow into our society every day. Also take into account that goes without saying that a variety of channels to provide the information required to pass the test would be available, be it in written, video form, in-person courses, and so on. All provided for free.\n\nOf course, there would be unlimited attempts possible, and of course, they would have time from the moment they start thinking of becoming parents to when the child is ~~, like, 3~~ X months/years old, and there would be extensions and exceptions for special cases.\n\nEDIT: specified what my idea of the test content would be, and clarified that the mention for 3 years old was a random example, not part of my opinion.\n\nEDIT 2: added examples that I found myself repeating in the comments and that give a better idea of what my intent for this is. Also mentioned the intent to provide all material required to pass the test for free and in a variety of forms to maximise accessibility.\n\nEDIT 3: added clarification on (the lack thereof) the connection between this view and eugenics. This has NOTHING to do with it.",

Where you are seeing 2nd or 3rd generation Americans are anti-immigrant, despite their family being immigrants and facing nativism themselves (I am sure there are many Trump supporting Italian, Irish and Latino Americans).\n\n\\*note, if you say the old line of \"I am not immigration just illegal immigration\", then lowering the barriers of immigration removed the issues of illegal immigration, and of course, the more people the merrier due to the demographic problems in the west.

        "author": "thetan_free",
        "selftext": "In the broader Anglosphere, the term \"middle-class\" is used to describe the socio-economic class of households that enjoy middle-level incomes but also a suite of social practices. While there is no universal definition, many would include things like a university-level education, salaried position in a profession or \"white-collar\" job, travel abroad, considerable savings and job/financial security and so on.\n\nIn the US, the term \"middle-class\" has been co-opted to describe now something closer to what the wider world understands as \"working class\" - people who have paid employment, possibly shiftwork or casualised, often in blue-collar trades, with significant financial precarity. Many American sitcoms show \"middle-class\" (US-sense) families - like *The Simpsons*. A recent [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/02/15/middle-class-financial-security/) poll suggested only 30% of Americans consider a college education a marker of being middle class. This is not how the term is used in the UK, Canada, Australia (or other English-speakers in, for example, India).\n\nThe point of the term \"middle-class\" is to indicate there is an economic class \"above\" (in some sense) and \"below\". Using the term \"middle-class\" to describe people who the wider world describe as \"working class\" is a form of flattery (maybe) but also a piece of political theatre: \"hey, you're not on food stamps so you're middle class\" is a great way to deflect from people being systematically exploited in ways out-of-step with other English-speaking countries.\n\nAmerica is - on a GDP per capita basis - the richest large country in the world. Even on a median basis, it's top ten. I don't believe a household which [can't cover $400 in an emergency](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/37-of-americans-cant-afford-an-emergency-expense-over-400-according-to-empower-research-302187157.html) should be described as \"middle-class\".  \n\nI would change my view if there is a sizeable (>20%) of households that are persistently substantially poorer again, warranting the description of this level of economic security as genuinely \"middle'.",

Many people don't say that explicitly, but the way they talk about muslims and Islam makes it very clear that that's what they believe.\n\nI am a materialists, therefore I do not believe that any idea is special. Not unless it's an idea about how to interact with the material world.  I believe that people are primarily the product of the material conditions that surround them, and not the ideas in their head. The only things that those ideas affect is who people see as the other and who they see as part of their group.\n\nI don't believe that Islam is a religion of peace. There's no such thing as a state religion that is a religion of peace.  A state must necessarily be violent. I've often heard things such as \"Well, Buddhism is a religion of peace, unlike Islam.\" But the few states which are and were historically buddhist, were also violent. Look at Myanmar and Ashoka's india, to name a couple. The only way a religion can be a religion of peace is if all its adherents live in isolation under the protection of a state, which they themselves don't run.\n\nIslam is not a religion of peace but it's no more violent than Christianity or Buddhism, not intrinsically at least. The violence of its adherents is a response to their shared environment. Just as the violence of medieval Christians was a response to their own shared environment.\n\nBut Muslims are perceived to be more violent than Christians now because they are the victims of colonization.\n\nIn this, I include how the dissolution of the Ottoman empire was handled; the invasions of Afghanistan by the USSR and the United States; the invasion of Iraq by the United States; what happened in Syria; what happened in Yemen; the Shah in Iran; the assassination of Mosaddegh; the French in Algeria. And that's just scratching the surface.\n\nThe picture is very clear though. Violent imperialism by the West and Russia have done a lot to destabilize Muslim countries, in order to gain access to their resources and markets. It has created an environment which is ripe for the kind of violent paramilitary organizations typical to those regions.\n\nThe fact that they are Islamic organizations performing jihad and not Christian organizations performing crusades is purely superficial.\n\nChange my view.\n\nEDIT: I mean to say that \"Muslims are perceived to be more violent than Christians\" not \"Muslims are more violent than Christians\" ",

        "title": "CMV: Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel are stupid even as a terror tactic, achieve nothing and only harm Palestine",
        "author": "Downtown-Act-590",
        "selftext": "First a disclaimer. We are not discussing morality of rocket attacks on Israel. I think that they are a deeply immoral and I will never change my mind about that. We are here to discuss the stupidity of such attacks, which should dissuade even the most evil terrorist from engaging in them (if they had a bit of self-respect). \n\nSo with that cleared up, we can start. Since cca. 2006, rocket attacks on Israel became almost a daily occurence with just few short pauses. Hamas and to a lesser extent Hezbollah would fire quite primitive missiles towards Israel with a very high frequency. While the exact number of the rockets fired is impossible to count, we know that we are talking about high tens of thousands.\n\nOn the very beginning, the rockets were to a point succesful as a terror measure and they caused some casualties. However, Israel quickly adapted to this tactic. The combination of the Iron Dome system with the Red Color early-warning radars and extensive net of bomb shelters now protects Israeli citizens extremely well. \n\nSure, Israeli air defence is costly. But not prohibitively costly. The Tamir interceptor for the Iron Dome comes at a price between 20k and 50k dollars (internet sources can't agree on this one). The financial losses caused by the attacks are relatively negligible in comparison to the total Israeli military budget. \n\nThe rocket attacks have absolutely massive downsides for Palestine though. Firstly, they really discredit the Palestinian cause for independence in the eyes of foreign observers. It is very difficult to paint constant terrorist missile attacks as a path to peace, no matter how inefficient they are. \n\nSecondly, they justify Israeli strikes within Gaza and South Lebanon which lead to both Hamas/Hezbollah losses and unfortunately also civilian casualties. How can you blame the Isralies when they are literally taking out launch sites which fire at their country, though?  \n\nThirdly, the rocket attacks justify the Israeli blockade of Gaza. It is not hard to see that Israeli civilians would be in great peril if Hamas laid their hands on more effective weapons from e.g. Iran. Therefore, the blockade seems like a very necessary measure. \n\nFourth problem is that the rocket production consumes valuable resources like the famous dug-up water piping. No matter whether the EU-funded water pipes were operational or not (that seems to be a source of a dispute), the fragile Palestinian economy would surely find better use for them than to send them flying high at Israel in the most inefficient terrorist attack ever. \n\nThere is a fifth issue. Many of the rockets malfunction and actually fall in Palestinian territories. This figures can be as high as tens of percents. It is quite safe to say that Hamas is much more succesful at bombing Palestine than Israel. \n\nYet, the missile strikes have very high levels of support in the Palestinian population. We do not have recent polls and the numbers vary, but incidental datapoints suggest that high tens of percents of Palestinians support them (80 percent support for the missile attacks (2014) or 40 percent (2013) according to wiki). I absolutely don't understand this, because to me the rockets seem so dumb that it should discourage even the worst terrorist from using them. \n\nTo change my view about sheer stupidity of these terror strikes, I would have to see some real negative effect which they have on Israel or positive effect which they have on Palestine.

        "selftext": "Jealousy is a natural human reaction and emotion, but the way to deal with it is sitting with yourself and working through it- or through conversations and communication with your partner. Not expecting your partner to accommodate your jealousy by creating \u201cboundaries\u201d that control or restrict their actions and behaviours. What I\u2019m talking about are things like not allowing your partner to be friends with certain people or go certain places. \n\nMost jealousy can be talked through and worked through. Trying to control or restrict their behaviour only shows a lack of trust. That lack of trust might be the result of personal history, trauma or issues- which again, should be dealt with internally or through communication. You can\u2019t solve internal issues through controlling others. \n\nOr the lack of trust may be completely justified- but in this case If you can\u2019t trust your partner to not be unfaithful without imposing restrictions on them, why are you with them in the first place? If they have violated your trust in the first place, imposing restrictions on them won\u2019t solve the underlying issues and most likely won\u2019t ensure they won\u2019t do it again. \n\nThis viewpoint is largely influenced by me being bisexual. While a lot of my straight friends treat things like not having friends of the opposite sex as a normal boundary in a relationship, me not being friends with someone I could *potentially* be attracted to would mean I would have no friends.

Less travels means less money spent on travel, meaning more money for the league. It could also be a good way to reduce the environmental impact of these sports.\n\n2. New Rivalries: Teams in the same city like the Dodgers/Angels and Giants/Jets have never had huge rivalries with each other, along with other teams in the same geographically area although being in different leagues. New rivalries birth more interest in the sports and increase media attention.\n\n3. Most Rivalries Stay the Same: Despite the new organization, most rivalries would stay the same. Yankees/Red Sox and Packers/Bears will likely be in the same division still, at least the same conference due to their relative closeness with each other. \n\n4. Improved Playoff Atmosphere: With teams that make the playoffs likely being closer together, this could improve the intensity and atmosphere at playoff matchups.

If there are any parts which you do not understand, I would appreciate if you pointed them out.\n\nI will preface this by saying that I study at a linguistic school focused mainly on humanities. I do not get along with my classmates and I routinely have claims like these, which get shunned over by them. I want to get an outside perspective, which is why I am writing here.  \n\n\n[Most cultures believe in the existence of a soul](https://generaleducation.missouri.edu/course/anthro-2220/#:~:text=Nearly%20all%20cultures%20), inner spirit, psyche, etc. which I strongly think is incorrect as there is no evidence pointing towards the existence of one. While one might argue that, since almost every culture shares this belief, it should be true, completely incorrect facts such as superstitions have been passed on through generations.\n\nIf one makes a claim about the existence of something, he should somehow prove or support the claim. I cannot think of a claim that is not \"our ancestors believed it\" for the existence of a soul, or, a more precise definition, something that makes a human \"human\" that could not be reproduced with sufficient time and technology.\n\n  \nI also strongly believe that a human is nothing but a clump of cells and minerals that could, with advanced technology, be grown in a lab and the thoughts of which could be simulated. I think the thought process is caused only by neurons communicating with each other and if each and every single neuron could be replaced by a machine that can send and receive the same signals, our \"consciousness\" would remain the same.\n\nEverything in the human body, from muscles contracting to the brain, is an extremely complicated machine. We can describe individual processes on a very small level (hormones, neuron pathways), but we are not yet sophisticated enough to describe the extremely complex interactions between them. Once we can, there will be nothing mystical about the process of thought.  \n\n\nTo sum my thoughts up, I believe there is nothing inherently special about humans, that we have a soul and a dog, ant or a bacteria does not.\n\n  \nI apologize if I made any errors with my description of the processes in the human body, as I only have a surface level understanding of biology.",

A significant factor in how groups are perceived differently, regardless of racism being present, is phenotype. European's were pretty baseless when creating scientific racism, but they were still able to identify features that separated sub-Saharan Africans farthest away from them. This lines up with sub-Saharan-Africans being the only people who have no neanderthal mixture. We've seen ethnic groups of people who weren't white previously become categorized as white later. This is both social and genetic, as looking white still depends on phenotype expression which is influenced by genes. Plenty of movies focusing on non-western cultures have placed white actors to play the non-western ethnicity, but this replacement doesn't happen to sub-Saharan Africans nearly as often because it's harder to pull off due to phenotypical and genetic distance. There's a reason people of sub-Saharan-African descent are dealing with hair discrimination in a way no other ethnic groups do. I believe the genetic distance is why being black is still viewed as the opposite of being white today despite segregation being over.\n\nAdditional Disclaimer: Regardless of if I'm right or wrong, genetic variation will always be inherently valuable and beneficial in any species and humans are no exception.

        "author": "Early-Possibility367",
        "selftext": "I think there is an erroneous belief among Zionists that they are hated for being pro Israel. I would say that they are not hated for being pro Israel. They are hated for saying that *others* need to be pro Israel, and that hate is generally justified. \n\nI kind of see it like this. If you like black tea, that is fine. It's none of my business. If you demand others must also like black tea, that is when you become invasive. Now, we do have exceptions to this rule. One can't say \"I think x race is lesser\" and expect to get away with it. But there is at present no social rule saying that people must talk respectfully about international boundaries or that people must limit themselves when saying one side in war needs to tone it down, even if that one side is the side playing defense. Zionists claim that especially the latter is a social rule but it never has been. This point will be expanded towards the end, and it is the most important point, so anyone who doesn't want to read all this can at least read from the bolded words near the end. \n\nI think Zionists justify their demand people be pro Israel based on a few things.\n\nThe first is that they say that there is an obligation to move on from historical injustices done against you. This is the main type used by Zionists specifically who agree with pro Palestinians that the creation of Israel was extremely immoral. They say that pro Palestinians have a responsibility to focus on the future. \n\nWhat I say to that is that such a rule is unfounded. There are tons of cultures where crying about the past is a massive part of the culture. Armenia is probably the best example. Both Koreas are another good example. As are the Balkans. And Morocco with the small parts of Spain that are bordering it. But really there are too many examples of this to list. \n\nBut I'd also say that it's common in many places that the locals cry about historically lost land. It can be useless, but uselessness is hardly a reason to deny someone a cultural practice. By this logic, athiests should be able to deny religious people the right to build churches. I do think uselessness is a valid reason to oppose an action, but not a valid reason to outright force someone to stop said action.\n\nNow, I do agree that it is true that Palestinians can't undo the fact that 76 years ago they lost their lands to hundreds of thousands of possibly the most evil settler colonialists to ever exist. That is a fact which nothing can be done about it. And yes, Palestinians have to look at solutions that don't involve a total reversal of the evil settler colonialism that was done to them just because practically they can't reverse it. But that does not mean they are not allowed to mourn their history like everyone else. Essentially, mourning history and making practical choices and accepting you were wronged are independent of each other, and Zionist are justified in calling for the latter but not the former.  \n\nEven then, reversal of settler colonialism is not inherently wrong, just practically impossible in this specific case, so the burden of proof falls onto Zionists to show why it's wrong in this case (though since this is a post about it being ok to be pro Palestine and not an endorsement of either side, we can assume they've arguably met that burden of proof). \n\nThe other big point Zionists like to make is that if one protests for a cause, that they must protest  similar injustices in the world. The issue with this is that single issue protesters have been a thing since forever. There's not many protestors who after they protest the cause they care most about   and then go and protest similar situations elsewhere. That's not including the fact that this point is inherently a whataboutism fallacy. If you say why not protest x if you're protesting y, that is undoubtedly whataboutism and a point that is too weak to stand on its own, let alone be strong enough to tell *others* what they can and can't do. \n\nIn fact, I'd say the left today operates under the opposite. Pick a few causes and specifically protest them, and maybe, but not necessarily, within protesting the few causes we choose, we'll give a small shoutout to the ones we didn't. \n\nSimilar to how pro Palestinians occasionally post about Congo and Sudan. This is a good example because the social left here chose the country with the most evil origin and the only one funded by the USA as of now, while a small minority still mention the other ones if they choose to. \n\nThe **last and most important point** is that America has never really had a standard where we are inherently required to support the actions taken in a war by the country playing defense. Most Americans choose to do so in most conflicts, but it's not a social requirement. \n\nTake for example Dresden. I am more neutral on Dresden but I think it makes sense to say that the Dresden bombings were a critical part of the UK's continued existence and that the UK did not have too many other options in securing their own continued existence and avoiding Nazi conquest. Yet, even in the face of all of that and the lack of obvious better solutions, not to mention the evil of Nazis themselves, being anti Dresden is still a perfectly socially acceptable position, simply because we allow people to oppose any act of war for pretty much any reason, whether offensive or defensive. Same could be said about the American bombings of Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and Tokyo. \n\nI feel like this has become even more socially acceptable with the fact many countries like Israel can defend themselves from future attacks without a single offensive strike based on the strength of their weapon repellants. It is generally socially acceptable to hold these countries to even higher standards than ones that don't have this ability, and as we discussed, we barely demand opinions one way or another for places that don't have that kind of defense. \n\nNow, I think there are plenty of strong arguments for being pro Israel on their own right, but when you are demanding someone else agree with you, a stronger burden of proof shifts on you, and I don't think the proof has been met for Zionists to demand *others* support Israel.

They're as delicate as phones. \n\nLooks- I personally hate the look. They Look like smooth ugly plastic crap. Like a kids toy with lights and sounds coming from the watch. Too 'nerdy'.\n\nConvenience- you're just going to be OCD, ADHD if you don't have time to pull out phone to look at information. You will just keep checking the watch. That's the problem of today- how to unplug!\n\nFitness:\n\nHeart rate monitor is not accurate on a smart watch. chest strap heart rate monitor is better (like polar or something)\n\nStep counter and GPS: this is pretty accurate on phone. I don't need this to be that accurate anyways, just need to get a sense of how long you walked. What do I care if I it's 50-100 steps less or more. I know the total time I worked out. Also I use a waist band when running to store my phone, it's pretty comfy for me. \n\nCalorie counter is well documented to be highly inaccurate in any devices, so don't even bother talking about that. Based on my workout time, distance etc, I have my own cheat sheet of how many calories I must have burnt and that's the most accurate and quickest method for tracking calories for me. Helps me meet weight and calorie goals. \n\nSleep analysis, does it really help? If I sleep for 7-8 hours, I feel good. If I ever sleep less, I don't feel that good. What other information helps really? Maybe someone with insomnia can benefit?\n\nSo, I don't think smart watches really improve health.\n\nEdit: by necessary, I mean, a smart phone is necessary for me for everything it does.

        "title": "CMV: The US should adopt a flat tax, only if it accompanies a negative income tax.",
        "author": "Opposite_Example_537",
        "selftext": "Taxes are very interesting. I have been reading through studies and, the more I read, the more I am convinced that a flat rate tax with a negative income tax (NIT) would be better for the country than the exisiting system we have.\n\nI'll start with the pros of a flat rate, then cover the cons, and how I believe a NIT would alleviate the shortcomings of a flat rate.\n\n**Pros of a Flat Tax over a Progressive Tax Structure**\n\nFrom the research I have reviewed, it\u2019s clear that a\u00a0**flat tax**\u00a0has notable advantages over the current\u00a0**graduated tax system**. One of the primary benefits of a flat tax is its\u00a0**simplicity**. By applying a single rate to all income levels, the system becomes more transparent and far easier to navigate, both for taxpayers and administrators. This simplicity reduces compliance costs and the burden on both individuals and businesses, something that is often cited in studies on tax reform in countries like\u00a0**Estonia**\u200b ([Tax Foundation](https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/growth-opportunity-us-tax-reform-plan/))\u200b([MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/11/22/6405)). In terms of economic incentives, I believe that a flat tax creates a more favorable environment for\u00a0**investment and labor participation**. The absence of progressive tax brackets means that individuals are not penalized for earning more, encouraging economic productivity. The\u00a0**Tax Foundation**\u2019s findings suggest that implementing a flat tax in the U.S. could lead to a 1.3% increase in GDP due to the improved incentives for both workers and investors.\n\nAdditionally, I have seen evidence indicating that a flat tax may reduce opportunities for\u00a0**tax evasion**. With a simplified tax system, loopholes are minimized, and compliance improves, as evidenced by countries like\u00a0**Estonia**, which reported improvements in tax collection and compliance after adopting a flat tax\u200b ([Finance Strategists](https://www.financestrategists.com/tax/tax-planning/flat-tax/)).\n\nFrom the studies I\u2019ve examined, simulations indicate that a flat tax rate of\u00a0**20-25%**\u00a0could potentially match the revenue generated by the current U.S. tax system\u200b. This range accounts for improvements in tax collection due to reduced evasion, as well as supplemental revenue from sources like corporate and consumption taxes. I believe that with a well-set rate, we could avoid significant losses in revenue while simplifying the system for taxpayers.\n\n**Cons of the Flat Tax System**\n\nHowever, while the simplicity and efficiency of a flat tax are clear, I recognize several significant limitations. One of the most glaring is the\u00a0**regressive nature**\u00a0of a flat tax. By taxing all income at the same rate, lower-income earners end up paying a larger percentage of their income relative to wealthier individuals. This disproportionately affects the poorest citizens, leading to greater\u00a0**income inequality**\u200b.\n\nIn reviewing the available data, I have also seen concerns regarding the impact on\u00a0**public services**. By reducing the tax burden on higher earners, a flat tax system may lead to a\u00a0**slight decrease in government revenue**. This, in turn, could reduce funding for essential services like healthcare and education, which are critical for lower- and middle-income families\u200b. Moreover, while a flat tax may streamline revenue collection, it does not offer a solution to\u00a0**income redistribution**, which is essential in addressing economic disparities. Without a mechanism for wealth redistribution, a flat tax fails to alleviate poverty or ensure that lower-income households receive adequate financial support\u200b.\n\n**Addressing Flat Tax Flaws through a Negative Income Tax (NIT)**\n\nIn the research I\u2019ve explored, it becomes evident that a\u00a0**Negative Income Tax (NIT)**\u00a0could effectively address the regressive shortcomings of a flat tax system. A\u00a0**Negative Income Tax**\u00a0is designed to provide direct financial support to individuals earning below a certain income threshold. By implementing an NIT alongside a flat tax, we coukd ensure that low-income earners receive a guaranteed income, mitigating the regressive effects of the flat tax\u200b ([UBI Center](https://www.ubicenter.org/us-flat-tax)).\n\nThe NIT would allow the tax system to maintain its\u00a0**simplicity**\u00a0while still redistributing income to those who need it most. Under an NIT, individuals earning below the threshold would receive cash transfers, creating an\u00a0**income floor**. This ensures that poverty levels are reduced, and no one is left behind in a flat tax structure. Empirical studies have shown that this system could maintain\u00a0**fiscal sustainability**\u00a0while offering more targeted poverty reduction compared to traditional welfare programs\u200b. I also believe that an NIT would encourage\u00a0**economic mobility**. Unlike traditional welfare systems, which often discourage individuals from working by cutting off benefits abruptly as income rises (the so-called \u201cwelfare cliff\u201d), an NIT phases out gradually. This ensures that people retain a portion of their income gains as they move up the income ladder, fostering a more inclusive economic structure.\n\n**In Summary**\n\nBased on the evidence I have gathered, a\u00a0**flat tax combined with a Negative Income Tax**\u00a0would provide a balanced approach to tax reform. A flat tax offers simplicity and economic incentives for growth, while an NIT ensures that lower-income individuals are protected. Together, these two mechanisms create a system that is more efficient, fair, and sustainable than the current progressive tax system.\n\nIn summary, I believe that this reform could lead to a tax system that promotes economic growth while ensuring that no one is unfairly burdened, making it a more effective and equitable alternative to the status quo.\n\nBut, with all that said, I'd love to hear the counterarguments to this idea--which I believe was proposed by Milton Friedman, who is someone I have many disagreements with.",

        "selftext": "What I mean by raceswapping is changing a white character to be a minority (Black, Asian, etc). I DO NOT mean whitewashing at all. Whitewashing typically takes away from the character\u2019s story/culture, representation, and status as a minority. There\u2019s millions of white characters, and to take the few non-white characters and change them is weird.\n\nA few examples of raceswapping in media:\n\n1. The Witcher (Fringilla or however you spell it lol)\n\n2. Starfire in Teen Titans\n\n3. Ariel from The Little Mermaid\n\n4. The Velayrons in HOTD \n\n5. Bridgerton (I think Queen Charlotte)\n\nMy opinion:\n\n1. She\u2019s just one example (she\u2019s so unimportant to the story so idk why ppl even care) but I\u2019ve seen ppl say blk ppl shouldn\u2019t even exist anywhere near the main story bc of the reason that\u2019s it\u2019s \u201cmedieval times.\u201d \ud83e\uddcd\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\n2. I PERSONALLY think Starfire is black-coded and I\u2019m fine with her being played by a black actress. I don\u2019t even think it\u2019s a race change bc she\u2019s bronze/orange, but I don\u2019t think a white person would look as good. Raven is supposed to be gray and they made her pale white, yet I don\u2019t see ppl complaining about that.\n\n3. This was straight up racism. Ariel being black impacted no one, didn\u2019t change the story, affected nobody\u2014 it was racism. They picked her because she was the best singer; bc she had they wanted as a singer and actor.   Having all her different sisters was cute too but I didn\u2019t see people complain about that; only Ariel being black.\n\n4. Another fantasy argument that I hate bc changing their race made the story better imo. I LOVE seeing blk ppl on screen and I think the reason they changed their race was bc they didn\u2019t want ppl getting confused (since Vela\u2019s and Targ\u2019s look extremely similar). \n\n5. This is a history argument that\u2019s plain stupid bc the show never claimed to be historically accurate.  It\u2019s set in historic London (Britain?) but that\u2019s it. Changing her race didn\u2019t mess up the story. Bridgerton also gets fairly good reviews (watched the first and second season and loved it). \n\nHonorary mentions; Rapunzel, Falcon becoming Captain America, the new Black Cat, Ironheart, etc. \n\nIn some cases, raceswapping adds to the story (i.e now you can add a racism aspect that deepens character relationships, etc). Big companies don\u2019t care about minority characters that are already made (most times) bc they know that won\u2019t sell. \n\nAm I mad about they don\u2019t talk abt minority characters? Yes. Do I care about the raceswapping? No. I like to see black people on screen. Every time I see a black person in a show or movie I don\u2019t expect them to be in, I get EXCITED. I think I genuinely get tired of seeing white people\u2014 and usually the exact same ones \u2014do so many different roles. I want new people, I want more minorities, I want more diversity. Hell, I\u2019ll take new white ppl I haven\u2019t seen before \ud83e\udd23 just give me something different!!! And when ppl scream about \u201cwokeness,\u201d it feels like a cover-up for racism. \n\nNobody is erasing white ppl. Nobody is taking their jobs when these minorities get the roles and not them (they\u2019re actors; there are thousands of other roles). The only ppl complaining are those who don\u2019t like seeing minorities on the screen. Not only that, but every iteration is going to be different based on the producer and the originals still exist in other forms of media. \n\nAriel being black doesn\u2019t erase the white Ariel. Starfire being black doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not an alien. Like, it just seems so weird to complain about something that literally doesn\u2019t hurt anyone.\n\nQUICK EDIT: characters that are white that have culture (?) like the Vikings are totally fine lol. there were blk Vikings but I don\u2019t expect to see them in shows/movies (if they are, cool). if the white character has some sort of culture tied to them, I say keep \u2018em the same usually (like a Snow White should def be pale white or white in general bc of the story lol). But a character like Velma from Scooby, I wouldn\u2019t mind a raceswap (not that shit show on MAX). ",

Simply looking at the differences in education, employment, housing, and the criminal justice system are still evident, yet the struggles of Black communities are frequently overlooked, as if past progress means current inequities no longer exist.\nAnother large argument I see which I feel is relevant to this point is the supposed \u201cAnti-White\u201d movement most people who subscribe to the belief that Black People are no longer suffering at the hands of racial injustice seem to fear. I do not believe there is a secret agenda against white people and I almost always see that any criticism of something a white person does (Regardless of if race was brought up at all) is followed up with a long thread of people being cheered on for saying \u201cOh, but if a Black Person did this no one would bat an eye.\u201d. Is this not the exact same thing they accuse Black People of doing?\nThis view, that is the view that Black People no longer suffer from racism, does absolutely nothing aside from minimize the experiences of Black People.",

This is more of an economic argument.\n\nIPhones no doubt are good at what they do, and sell for about 799$ starting in the USA, comparable to that market. However, they have abused this reputation to supply sub-par flagships at exorbitant prices, in places where the competition is much fierce. And they have succeeded: iPhones have 22% market share in EU.\n\nNow people can buy what they want, so companies can sell for what they want. Apple is supposed to be a niche luxury product, just like branded bags or clothings, but consumer demand has buoyed them. But these luxury products are supposed to have a small market share. So we need EU to take a lead and bring consumer demand down, so they are forced to compete better in the market.\n\n1. A 799$ iphone sells for 999eur in Finland, and 950eur in rest of EU. That's a very big markup and people need to understand that. 5-6% sales tax in US states doesn't justify it.\n\n2. Android market in EU is very competitive, not like the USA, so if anything, Apple should be selling iphones for less, not more than USA.\n\n3. Consumers don't need a new iPhone each year, especially when the value of the phone plummets like crazy in few years.\n\n4. You can get a decent Samsung or OnePlus phone for 400 eur in EU, so the extra 600eur of cash is about monthly 100eur increased salary (before taxes for appropriate brackets). That's a very big foregoing of purchasing power for just a phone. That's much more than annual inflation adjustment in salaries. \n\n5. This doesn't consider the other fees like monthly iCloud fees that are due to apple's reluctance to support mass moving of data from iphones to other storage devices. \n\nSo is there any reason why people shouldn't act informed and shouldn't boycott iPhones? To drive their economics to a more sane level? The company won't let go of it's profits, and therefore why not us consumers?",

Who the president is\n\nHint: it\u2019s not Donald Trump in this scenario.\n\nNow what is the importance of this? Well this means that Trump no longer has discretion over certain forces like the national guard. This means the capitol in this scenario will be loaded to the brim if there is plans for a second event. We know from the Jan 6th commission Mike Pence was the one who called in the national guard not Trump.\n\nThis ultimately means that another January 6th would be shut down pretty quick if the need for back up was needed.\n\n2. Associated risk\n\nIt\u2019s not like when January 6th happened it ended well for those who participated. Many people were arrested, had the FBI on their doorstep or became socially ostracized. Now imagine that with more security and a president who is fully willing to enforce control measures on those participating not limited to arrests. \n\nIt\u2019s not like Trump supporters are young and single either, most of these people are way older. Look up any criminal study and you\u2019ll find that most people who commit crimes, man or woman, are more likely to be single, not have established careers or have children. These are far more likely to occur with age, and without an active youth who does not have as much stakes in society you can\u2019t really expect it to go so well. \n\nNow if Biden pardoned those who participated, we would have a different story. I say this because that would make Joe Biden look incredibly weak and make it look like you could just walk all over him. There has been cries for Jan 6th participants to be released since day 1 and Joe Biden has not budged in the slightest.  \n\n3. The fear instilled in to those who support Trump about the consequences for those who participated in Jan 6th\n\nPretty much every big pundit who supports Trump unconditionally has called those arrested for participating in January 6th political prisoners, wrongfully charged and even said these people were jailed without trial when they were just put in Pre-Trial detention which are two different things.\n\nThis really does nothing but instill the idea that Biden (or harris if it\u2019s post inauguration) would arrest them and keep them in jail. \n\n\n\n\nSo yea, there\u2019s my view, change it.",

I think it\u2019s fair to say that interpersonal racism against whites is less of a problem for a lot of reasons (either because it\u2019s less common, it doesn\u2019t tap into trauma in the same way it does for POC, or it has less severe effects because anti-white rhetoric doesn\u2019t affect whites systematically). But because those arguments are more complicated and people don\u2019t wanna take the effort to make them, they come up with this new definition of racism that makes no sense and just serves to shut up people who don\u2019t agree with it.\n\nIf interpersonal racism is only valid when accompanied by systemic racism, asian americans who aren\u2019t first-gen immigrants can\u2019t experience racism, since they don\u2019t experience racism systemically. Other racial minorities can\u2019t experience racism from black americans since black people suffer from systemic racism in america more than any other group by far, and therefore have less power in society.\n\nIf interpersonal racism was defined by the existence of systemic racism, there would be no need to distinguish the two. But it\u2019s really important to understand the differences between types of racism so we can be specific when talking about racism and discussing its consequences. If this means acknowledging that white people can technically experience racism, that\u2019s fine and doesn\u2019t contradict the struggles of racial minorities. I also think turning the definition of racism into an equation is trying to \u201cquantify\u201d racism and turning it into oppression olympics which is always unhelpful.\n\nI want my view changed because if there\u2019s a good reason for me to agree with the \u201cprejudice + power\u201d statement, I wanna know about it.",

The problem with Whitewashing is erasing the identity of the character. Therefore i dont think it's fair to say she is blackwashing. But im open to change my mind. My main contempt is the comment section and oh boy do they sound racist af.\n\nNow, blackwashing technically doesnt have the same definition in the dictionary as whitewashing so u can technically say it doesnt exist. But thats a mute point. Morality can exist before the word is created. \n\nWhitewashing (to alter (something) in a way that favors, features, or caters to white peopleo)is bad because it erases the history and identity of a character. Which i agree with. However, you can, for example, draw black panther white for your white brother who loves him so much for him to relate to black panther more i.e what the girl in the reel is trying to do. And that is by definition not whitewashing. Consequently, someone can blackwash (to alter (something) in a way that favors, features, or caters to black people) a character and it would be bad as you are trying to also remove the history and identity of the character. And of course, inversely, you can draw captain america as black for your black brother etc. and it would be ok.\n\nIf the main contempt with whitewash is :\n1) intent : not everyone is racist\n2) history : everything has to start somewhere. Just cus blackwashing a mexican character to remove the history and identity hasn't happened in the past doesnt mean its not wrong until 200 years later.\n3) impact : i'd say \"the golden rule\". Treat others the way you want to be treated. If you dont want your black characters to be whitewashed, dont blackwashed other people's characters.\n\nVery Sorry for bad formation of words/english.

(The following points will exclude rape and murder, those are treated fairly in my opinion)\n\nHowever, building a system based on punishment and making people\u2019s lives as miserable as possible simply doesn\u2019t work. For example, the US has notably longer sentences for almost every crime. This is supposed to de incentivize crime, but is statistically ineffective and logically what criminal even knows the time  for the crime they are doing, much less has some kind of expected value model for a crime where they would care about the exact number of years if they got caught. This costs taxpayers significantly more and provides no added benefit to anyone\n\nAlso the system is in many ways designed to have poor treatment of prisoners. This seems to make sense to stop crime, but in reality just causes more hate in the heads of prisoners. If the state treats you like less than a human, you\u2019re not going to be more likely to follow its rules.\n\nTertiarilly the system makes it very difficult for people to have jobs (due to a felony being on record) and normal lives (due to psychological effects) after prison, which make repeat crime extremely likely especially considered prisoners aren\u2019t taught anything reformational in prison. All they are taught is more hate.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t even consider the other issues with the justice system such as racial inequities and many people being punished for crimes that do not harm any person in any way shape or form. (Smoking weed for example)\n\nTLDR: being \u201ctough on crime\u201d doesn\u2019t do anything to help crime and makes the lives of the thousands of people that go through the justice system considerably worse all while wasting money that would be far better spent on measures that actually prevent crime by providing resources to struggling people to give them other options.

I am saying that a horrific belief is justified and rational IF a premise that I believe to be false (but believed by many) is granted.\n\nSo, according to this [poll](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2021/11/23/views-on-the-afterlife/#:~:text=About%20three%2Din%2Dten%20U.S.,can%20lead%20to%20eternal%20life), around 30% of American Christians believe that only Christians go to heaven and everyone else goes to Hell. Now Heaven is commonly defined as an eternal life of happiness, with hell being an eternal life of torture and suffering. I think many fail to grasp how ginormous eternity is. Your fate in Heaven and Hell is literally going to happen forever, with no recourse. Everything that happens in this life is essentially useless, a tiny blip that will eventually be indistinguishable from 0. Even if hell maybe isn't just all horrible suffering, but just not enjoying the benefits of heaven, depriving someone of that happiness for eternity still seems horrible.\n\nThus, if you truly believe that heaven and hell are eternal and your fate is determined by your belief in Christianity, then that is the only thing that really matters. It doesn't really matter how shitty (or not) your life is now, since the eternal afterlife is infinite. And crucially, your goal should be to save as many people as hell from possible.\n\nSo really, you should dedicate your life to converting as many people as possible, or making a ton of money to donate to organizations that convert as much as possible. Find the highest paying job you can, get by with the bare minimum, cause quality of life in this life really doesn't matter. Every bit of effort should be made so that other people can be saved from hell. If you truly cared about your non-Christian friends, how could you not spend all your time trying to convert them?\n\nOn a more governmental level, there's no reason to support religious freedom for non-Christians, or not support Christian indoctrination in public schools. They should enforce their extreme pro-life vision, since the bible says personhood begins at conception, and abortion destroys the ability for a fetus to become Christian, dooming them to hell. It would be perfectly rational to lock up parents that don't teach their children Christianity. Parents who do that are forcing their children to live a life of eternal suffering, a crime second to none. It would be monstrous NOT to have theocratic state that makes sure everyone is Christian and enjoys heaven.\n\nThis is why I personally find religious belief to be so dangerous, if you accept certain unjustified assumptions, horrific conclusions become rational. The non-horrific conclusions would themselves be horrific if some of these premises were true. Yet, somehow, I bet a huge percentage of the 30% of Christians who believe the premise don't do everything I've listed out.\n\nAgain, I am not saying I personally support theocracy, since I of course reject the starting premise.\n\nWhat will not change my view: Contesting the IF premise, which I already believe to be false, and is not the point of this CMV. OR Saying that heaven and hell aren't that extreme, since eternity is still so great.\n\nWhat will Change my view: Reasons why it is ok to not put all your effort into getting as many into heaven as possible.",

I completely disagree with the tipping culture in America, but I understand the reasons behind - servers getting paid less than minimum wage, relying on tips to make a living. I'm not aspiring to change this reality.\n\nWhat doesn't make sense to me is that tips are calculated based on the % of your total bill. My main argument here is that it doesn't take more work to bring a plate of lobster than it does to bring a plate of fries or breadsticks. Why should one result in a significantly higher tip than the other?\n\nWhat I also don't like is the completely discretionary nature of tipping, i.e. the customer deciding on the amount, while simultaneously under societal pressure to tip.\n\nI suggest two possible approaches, to charge a fixed service/waiter fee:\n\n1) per person at the table. This is similar to the Italian \"coperto\", where you are charged a few euros per person sitting at the table. Depending on how many dishes and drinks you ordered, the coperto is usually between 10-20% of the total amount.\n\n2) per plate/drink ordered. The waiter's job is mostly to take your order, bring you your food and then remove empty plates and glasses once done. The amount of work they need to do is correlated strongly with the size of your group and how much stuff each person orders. The menu could mention something like \"$2 service fee added to each item ordered\".\n\nThis approach would add transparency to the customer, as well as still enable waiters to make ends meet.",

        "selftext": "\"Government overspending\" has taken on new significance because it's been tied to inflation by some people, including Elon Musk to his 200 million followers on X.  \n\nThe facts are that for every president since Carter, without exception, Democrats preside over reductions in the federal deficit and Republicans preside over increases in the federal deficit.  And Trump presided over a quintupling of the federal deficit, while Biden has nearly halved the federal deficit.    \n  \nThis is because Republicans cut taxes on the wealthy, while Democrats restore taxes on the wealthy.  \n\nRepublicans say the tax cuts pay for themselves, but the economy's actually stronger under Democrats as well.  And this issue is also a good opportunity to tout that Trump's tax cuts for the wealthy didn't boost the economy because GDP growth has been 3.4% under Biden and 1.18% under Trump (2.4% under Trump before covid).  \n\nThese are big wins on major concerns to the American public that Democrats should get credit for.  Some Democrats have expressed frustration that facts such as these \"don't matter.\"  Facts don't matter if people don't know of them.  And these facts have not been communicated to the American public at high-visibility events, by someone who could communicate (i.e., not the current president), and by means of a clear comparison (i.e., not a platitude).  \n\nThe VP debate on Oct. 1st may be the last, best chance of this campaign for Harris-Walz to tout these wins.  It will have maybe 30 million viewers.  Tim Walz may more qualified to talk about fiscal sustainability because his government in Minnesota has a surplus.  But Walz must make the track record clear by a comparison between Dems and Repubs and between Biden and Trump.  (The reason for offering this historical track record comparison is so viewers don't think the edge over the past two admins is anomalous.) \n\nIn 2020, it was the Fox presidential debate moderator Chris Wallace who actually pointed out the GDP edge for Obama over Trump.  Dems will not be so lucky as to have a moderator point out a track record advantage in 2024.  \n\nDemocrats have been trying specifically to recruit young men, and these fiscal issues are the issues that men are more likely to care about.  \n\nCMV.  \n",

        "title": "CMV: Religions should be allowed into public discourse (but not into the institutional sphere) because of their inherent revolutionary potential. ",
        "author": "Material-Garbage7074",
        "selftext": "I know that it has been hypothesised that religion is a human universal, and that since it is rather implausible that it should have developed independently in thousands of different cultures, the hypothesis has been put forward that it is very, very deeply rooted in human nature: it is therefore possible to believe that it exists to fill a lack of explanation. However, some evolutionists believe that it has played a fundamental role in the functioning of human civilisations: firstly, it allows a group to define itself as such; secondly, it co-ordinates group behaviour; thirdly, it provides a powerful moral incentive system, encouraging cooperation and discouraging selfishness.\n\nThe motivational nature of the idea of God was also grasped - from a different angle - by the philosopher Iris Murdoch. Murdoch's starting point was a largely pessimistic Freudian type of psychology, in which the psyche is interpreted as an egocentric system of quasi-mechanical energy, largely determined by the individual's history and subject to ambiguous natural attachments that are difficult to control: as a moral philosopher, Murdoch had wondered how to deal with the fact that a large part of human behaviour seems to be governed by an egocentric type of mechanical energy. The philosopher questioned the existence of techniques capable of purifying an egocentric energy by its very nature, so as to enable human beings to act in the right way at the moment of choice. He wanted to focus on the nature of prayer, which is not, as one might think, a request: it is rather a simple act of attention directed towards God, which is a form of love. It is accompanied by the idea of grace, that is, of a supernatural support for human endeavour, capable of transcending the empirical limits of personality.\n\nFrom the perspective explored by Murdoch, God can be conceived as a single, perfect, transcendent object of attention that cannot be represented and is not necessarily real: God can be considered an object of attention to the extent that a believer is fortunate enough to focus his or her thoughts on something that can represent a source of energy. The philosopher explains the concept of an energy source by comparing it to falling in love: it would make little sense for a spurned lover to tell himself that he is no longer in love, because that would have no effect. Instead, he needs a reorientation that can secure energy from another source: God, in this sense, can be a very powerful source of energy - often good - if one pays attention to him, and - indeed - a person's ability to act in the right way when the moment calls for it depends to a large extent on the quality of his usual objects of attention. \n\nIn this sense, I do not believe that there should be a clear separation between religion and politics; on the contrary, I believe that there is an intrinsic revolutionary potential in religion (as long as it is separated from temporal power) and that it is possible for religion to have a motivational power capable of calling to action greater than that of a philosophical treatise. We must not forget that the first Christians were persecuted also and above all for political reasons: in a relatively tolerant world like that of Rome, it was the cult of the emperor that held the empire together. The fact that Christians steadfastly refused to do so and paid with their lives was a revolutionary act (after all, our political idea of equality derives from the Christian idea of the equality of all souls before God).\n\nThink of the preacher John Ball, who preached social equality during the Wat Tyler rebellion in England and was hanged and quartered for his revolutionary sermons after the rebellion failed. Or to the Italian Girolamo Savonarola, who (at the time of the expulsion of the Medici from Florence and the proclamation of the Florentine Republic) argued that Florence should make Christ King of the city: in this way, on the one hand, no one would be able to make himself a prince and, on the other, this would mean a solemn commitment to live according to divine law. Savonarola's politico-religious project had little success: he was deconsecrated and hanged. Or we can remember Thomas M\u00fcntzer, who, because of his (Protestant) religious faith, led the German peasants' revolt for justice based on biblical principles and paid with his life.\n\nWe may also recall John Milton who, in the Areopagitica, also argues for the overcoming of the dietary prohibitions for Christians in an intellectual sense, stating that this also applies to books, because books are the food of the mind (here somewhat different from the Inquisition's theories on the subject), and in the Tenure of Kings and Magistrates, one of the arguments used in this regard is the fact that Ehud killed the tyrant Eglon. Earlier, Milton had defended divorce on the basis of Deuteronomy. \n\nCromwell is very interesting, too: I seem to recall that in some of his speeches Oliver expressed the idea that the English were a chosen nation (analogous to Israel in the Bible) and that the course of England's history since the Reformation was an indicator of its special destiny. Such a belief (which, however, predated Cromwell and was shared by other revolutionaries, including Milton) was based on the Calvinist principle of God's chosen ones, which applied not only to individuals but also to nations. \n\nHowever, Oliver's conception did not identify the people of God with any particular religious sect; on the contrary, he believed that God's children were scattered in a number of different religious communities (including Jews: in fact, exiled from England since 1290, they managed to return and obtain a synagogue and a cemetery thanks to the Lord Protector), which is why he advocated a certain tolerance between different churches (he believed in the plurality of God's purposes). Moreover, I seem to recall that while Anglicans and English Catholics were not tolerated in law, they were tolerated in practice (according to the testimony of the Venetian ambassador of the time, if I am not mistaken). Indeed, some historians have gone so far as to say that English Catholics were less harassed under the Lord Protector than under the Stuarts. Oliver also knew that the consciences of the common people could not be changed, and that even the Papists were tolerable as long as they were peaceful. \n\nEven the most politically extreme movements of the time had strong religious underpinnings. The Diggers were certain that the abolition of private property and human bondage would reverse the fall of Adam and bring every soul to God. The Ranters went further, believing that their communion with God freed them from all moral laws, including those that condemned drunkenness, adultery, theft or required the wearing of clothes. The Quakers, then led by George Fox, roamed the country, interrupting worship and teaching that the inner light of the Spirit transcended all theological speculation and all historical documents, including the Bible. Not forgetting the Fifth Monarchists, who - based on a prophecy in the Book of Daniel that four ancient monarchies (Babylonian, Persian, Macedonian and Roman) would precede the fifth (to be understood as the reign of Christ and his saints on earth) - saw in the regicide of 1649 the end of the last tyrant and in the obvious divine signs present in the great victories achieved by the army the preparation of the fifth monarchy, headed by Christ, which would rise around 1666 and last 1,000 years.\n\nIn the following century, Robespierre could be added to the list. In fact, in some of his speeches, there is no shortage of references to the eternal Providence that would call the French people to re-establish the rule of liberty and justice on earth and that would watch over the Party of Liberty: the worship of God, in Robespierre's image of him, coincides with that of justice and virtue (the same virtue that he himself had defined as the soul of the Republic and the altruism that confuses all private interests with the general interest). Perhaps this was one of the reasons why the Incorruptible proclaimed a national holiday in honour of the Supreme Being on 8 June 1794, declaring that the Supreme Being had entrusted France with the mission of great deeds and had given the French people the strength to carry them out. The Incorruptible also defended the rights of the Jews, considering the persecutions they suffered in various countries to be \"national crimes\" for which France should atone by restoring to the Jewish people \"those inalienable human rights which no human authority can take away from them\", \"their dignity as men and citizens\".  \n\nIn the following century, one of the greatest exponents of this revolutionary religiosity was Giuseppe Mazzini. The central notion of Mazzini's religiosity is that of progress, through which it is possible to show the educational function of religion within humanity: the first human beings, according to Mazzini, were at best able to glimpse a confused relationship between God and the individual and, hardly able to detach themselves from the sphere of sensible objects, substantiated one: Mazzini defines this moment in the history of religion as fetishism: similarly, these early men, unable to separate themselves from the sphere of immediately visible affections, related themselves directly to themselves in the moral sphere, making the family (the reproduction of their individual) the basis of morality. Later, the idea of God evolved and became more abstract, becoming the protector not of a single family but of the union of several families: the advent of polytheism led to a widening of the moral circle, recognising the existence of duties towards the city or one's own people. Such civilisations, however, regarded non-citizens as barbarians and recognised the existence of people who could not be admitted to the rights of citizenship. Only the unity of God could show the unity of humanity: this, already suspected by Judaism - although it believed that only one people was chosen by God - was finally recognised by Christianity: duties to humanity were added to those to the fatherland.\n\nThe society of the modern world is also the child of the religious education of its time: liberal individualism is nothing but the child of the exaggeration of the principles of Protestantism, which led many thinkers to focus exclusively on the independence of the individual, an idea that led to the oppression of those who, deprived of time and education, were unable to educate themselves or participate in political life. The emancipation of the latter could only be built on the basis of a shared belief in the common duty to participate in the progressive unification of humanity. In order to achieve this last objective, Mazzini dreamed (just as he foresaw, in the political field, the election of a constituent assembly capable of calling the people to be the protagonists of national life) of convening a Council of Humanity capable of drawing up a declaration of principles by which the believers of each religion - Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Christians - could finally feel themselves brothers: In this way the nations would be able to unite and form the fatherland of fatherlands, in which the word \"foreigner\" would no longer be heard from the lips of men (however willing he would have been to accept a popular vote in favour of monarchy, he would hardly have been able to do the same for a popular vote in favour of atheism). Moreover, as already mentioned, the idea of humanity is, in the ideas of the apostle of the Risorgimento, a normative principle of emancipation: the principle of the unity of the human family should have led to the inclusion in it of women, at that time civilly, politically and socially excluded from that unity.\n\nIt should be remembered that the Roman Republic of 1849 (in my opinion one of the most glorious events to have taken place in Italy in the last four centuries), established after the flight of Pope Pius IX from Rome following the assassination of the Minister of Finance, Pellegrino Rossi, opened its proclamations \"in the name of God and of the people\" (without intermediaries). The Republic (of which Mazzini was a triumvirate, together with Carlo Armellini and Aurelio Saffi, and which was strongly inspired by Mazzini's principles) had enshrined principles such as universal male suffrage - female suffrage was not actually forbidden by the Constitution, but women were excluded by custom - the abolition of the death penalty and torture. Other principles enshrined in the republican constitution were the secular nature of the state, freedom of religion and opinion (and hence the abolition of censorship), the abolition of confiscation of property, the repeal of the papal rule excluding women from the right of succession, and the right to a home (established through the confiscation of ecclesiastical property). It took more than a century for these reforms, later reversed by papal reaction, to become a reality throughout Europe.\n\nThis glorious republican experiment was (ironically) suppressed by Europe's only other republic, France, whose president, Louis Napoleon (the Pope's watchdog, even more odious than his uncle) decided to intervene: I apologise to the French who will read this, but I have problems with usurpers of republics) decided to intervene to secure the support of French Catholics (although some Italian Catholics took part in the defence of the Republic, including the Barnabite friar Ugo Bassi, who was shot by the Austrians for this: the Italian Orthodox Church is currently starting the cause of his beatification, if I remember correctly). But the Republic held out until the end, thanks to the contribution of patriots from Italy, from Europe (the Polish Legion is usually mentioned, but volunteers also came from France itself: the French republican Gabriel Laviron died fighting against his brothers) and from the rest of the world (the story of Andres Aguyar, a Uruguayan ex-slave who had followed Garibaldi to Italy and died for Rome, is noteworthy).\n\nThen there is the American hero John Brown - sentenced to death for attempting to lead a slave rebellion just before the Civil War - an evangelical Christian, deeply influenced by the Puritan faith of his upbringing, who believed he was an instrument of God raised up to deal the death blow to American slavery. I  think he was influenced partly by Puritan intransigence towards sin, which led him to positions of moral intolerance that made him ready to strike at those who, in his eyes, were rebellious against divine laws and therefore deserving only of destruction, and partly by personal experience: if I remember rightly, it is said that when he was twelve years old he found himself working alongside a slave of his own age who was being beaten with an iron shovel in front of him. When young John asked the man why he was being treated like this, the answer was that he was a slave: partly because of his Puritan upbringing, Brown was led to believe that this child had a Father, God, and that the slave owner was therefore sinning against the Most High. If I remember correctly, Brown said that he followed both the Golden Rule and the Declaration of Independence, and that he believed that the idea of treating one's neighbour as oneself and the fact that all men are created equal meant the same thing. \n\nAlso noteworthy is the poetess T\u00e1hirih', who, as a Muslim, became one of the nineteen disciples of the Bab and, believing that Islamic law was no longer binding on the B\u00e1b\u00ed, chose to remove her veil, believing that the unveiling of women was an act of religious innovation. He also wrote poetry of an anticlerical nature. In September 1852, after refusing to abjure, T\u00e1hirih was strangled and thrown into a well. Her last words are said to have been: 'You can kill me all you want, but you cannot stop the emancipation of women'.\n\nEven Gandhi - who, in devising the method of satyagraha, not only drew inspiration from Hindu culture and the Bhagavadg\u012bt\u0101, but also juxtaposed these writings with others, both religious (including the Bible, the Koran, and theosophical writings) and philosophical (including the works of Thomas Carlyle, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Thomas Huxley, John Ruskin, Henry David Thoreau, Leo Tolstoy, and Giuseppe Mazzini) - believed that politics and religion (the latter not in a sectarian sense, but as the universal recognition of a fundamental divinity pervading all things) were two inseparable spheres, for on the one hand he strongly condemned politics deprived of its religious dimension, and on the other he believed that religiosity should address and help solve practical problems.\n\nThe pirate legend of Libertalia can also be placed in this context. The story goes that a French captain, Misson, on leave in Rome, was so disgusted by the luxury of the papal court that he lost his faith. There he met Caraccioli, a heretical priest who, through his speeches, convinced Misson and much of the crew that every man was born free, that he had as much right to it as to the air he breathed, and that the only thing that distinguished one man from another was wealth.  Convinced by this strange priest, the crew decided to become pirates and founded a colony they called Libertalia. Vehemently opposed to the social institutions of their time (including monarchies, slavery, institutional religion and the abuses associated with wealth), these pirates practised direct democracy and the sharing of goods. They also created a new language for their colony and adopted the motto \"For God and Liberty!\".\n\nAs Habermas notes, philosophy has often been able to realise the innovative impulses it has received when it has been able to liberate such cognitive contents from their dogmatic isolation: indeed, it seems that religious traditions are far more intense and vital than metaphysics. For such a learning process to take place, however, the followers of the various religions will have to abandon their almost sectarian separation from one another and enter into dialogue with one another and with modernity. Non-believers will also be able (or will have to) engage in dialogue: as we have seen, many concepts that are now part of the secular vocabulary of liberal democracy have long been shaped by a purely religious history. Secularists may be able to find in religious contributions significant semantic content (which they may have intuited without - however - being able to make it explicit), content that could be transferred to the level of public argumentation. \n\nThis is why I believe that there is no clear difference between religion and the political sphere, also because the personal is political: I believe that the religious and the political spheres should be placed in separate spheres, in the institutional sphere (any temporal power is bad both for politics - because it would take away space for dissent - and for religion, because in such a situation it is easy for religion to become an instrument at the service of power, to lose its revolutionary potential and to become corrupt), but not in the sphere of public discourse (obviously all religions should be allowed, without discrimination).\n\nIt can also work from another point of view: according to Machiavelli, conflict is not in itself a cause of weakness, but rather gives dynamism to the political complex, keeps it alive; this vitality produces progress insofar as it leaves open spaces of freedom, which consists in the prerogative of each party to intervene in political decisions by clashing with the other parties. For this to happen, however, there must be a public political space in which virtue, understood as a passion for what is public, can develop (this is why the model of ancient republican Rome was a winner). In this sense, such a model could help to channel the religiously motivated conflict in the right direction, with surprising results.\n\nBut even if one were to adopt John Milton's view that, by suppressing every possibility of vice, one would also suppress those virtues which only freedom can produce, and according to which truth and error are confused and can only be distinguished through the free confrontation of opinions (hence the famous \u00abGive me the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely according to conscience, above all liberties\u00bb), this project could still work. Habermas even goes so far as to imagine the possibility of a convergence of the great universalist religions around a core of moral intuitions consisting of equal respect for the integrity of each person to be protected and for the fragile intersubjectivity of all forms of life. This suggests the possible existence of a minimal common consensus on the normative content of the metaphysical interpretations and prophetic doctrines affirmed throughout universal history, on which the community of religions could base the norms of peaceful coexistence among nations, especially - I would add - in the age of globalisation, where interdependence is constantly increasing.",

Fantasy and Sci-Fi even when written by progressive writers are a very conservative genre where nothing changes.\n\nI understand why very religious people would oppose these ideas. \n\nBut most writers that are overly religious avoid those two genres anyways. \n\nThe point is that none of those things are intrinsically evil.\n\nA necromancer could use a gun to kill anyone instead of a zombie. Bringing back dead people is only bad if the resurrected tries to harm living people.\n\nA lich is only evil if they are evil or if they seek to extend their lifespan by stealing it from somebody else.\n\nEven the OG SciFi story is more nuanced. The \"monster\" Prometheus, in Frankenstein did not start evil. Frankenstein is portrayed as a shitty father that tries to kill Prometheus out of petty fear and jealousy he will create a race of superior beings.\n\nShelley had a shitty relationship with her mother and was criticizing both God and her mother in her story. Later stories miss this and are lesser by making Prometheus a mindless brute and evil.\n\nAll of this is classified as bad or hubris due playing god or whatever but the same was said of things that were once fiction. For example heart transplants and IVF.\n\nAnd only ghouls still call IVF persons soulless..\n\nIf human cloning was real it would be no different than having a child.\n\nI have even seem some non-Christian writers do the same, which is insane. It is some kind of inferiority complex. \"Man is not supposed to meddle, us mere mortals are lesser beings!\"\n\nIt reminds me of the rhetoric that was used to forbid slaves from learning to read. Or the people that opposed heart transplants as I already mentioned, that also got called playing god.\n\nThe gods of these stories are petty and insecure. Any God worth worshipping would encourage Prometheus(the Titan not the dude from Frankenstein) for helping humanity.\n\nI have never seen a secular argument why any of these things are intrinsically evil. \n\nThe author could make a story where accounting is evil by having a serial killer accountant, yet accounting is not evil. Same with necromancers.\n\nYou know what is evil? What is done to stop these things in stories, not only it makes them boring, look at men in black or harry potter erasing the minds of people to \"prevent panic\".\n\nAs tv tropes said \"Reed Richards is useless\". Writers never try new things, the same canned laughter, the same Faustian story over and over again. I would understand if they were conservatives but even outside of TV in web novels we see the same!\n\nI get it that artists try to criticize society and therefore technology but it gets tiring you know?\n\nIf you don't agree provide me secular reasons why these things are forbidden by being inherently evil, not due to an accident.\n\nIf you do agree give me recommendations for stories",

        "author": "Bambification_",
        "selftext": "Its my view that believing in a religion, any religion, means that you have given up part of what makes you truly human, by putting some invisible force(s) and your own ego, above the real people who exist in front of you. The Abrahamic religions are the worst offenders and also provide the best examples for this, so I will mention them a few times, but I still beleive that this applies to all religions as well as \"spiritualities\".\n\nBelieving that you are part of a special group, hand chosen by god(s) or some other invisible/infallible force, to be able to understand and perceive supernatural phenomena which others can't, because it makes you feel good and special, is the basis of most religion/spirituality when you really boil it down. Thats what a prayer is, thats what a \"relationship with god\" is, thats what Astrology is, thats what a Chakra is, thats what energy crystals are.\n\n A special world or energy which only the believer can perceive, where there is a being or force that makes all the final judgments in the universe, all of which just so happen to outline the believer as a good person and anyone different as a bad person. Also the being/force has threatened to punish you and your loved ones forever if they don't do everything the way the believer says it should be done. That is absolute peak narcissism, as well as the bare minimum belief required to follow *any* religion. Even if your a Wiccan, Pagan, or just \"spiritual\" you still have to beleive that you have some sort of special power or insight that others don't, which is still incredibly narcissistic (or could even be a sign of serious mental illness like schizophrenia). When a character has supernatural powers, we call them a superhuman and think of them as more-than-human; if you beleive *you* have supernatural powers (praying, crystal energy, tarot, etc.), then you are viewing *yourself* as more-than-human, thats narcissistic.\n\nI think this narcissism and lack of humanity is shown very clearly through the ways in which religion combats science and rational thought. Jehovas witnesses and Christian extremists denying blood transfusions and other life saving medical care on behalf of their children, is a great example. We can prove beyond the shadow of a doubt, with many different kinds of evidence, that a child who needs a transfusion will die if they don't receive it; yet theists can take advantage of they're legal protections to assert something completely unprovable and it somehow is allowed to superceed our entire body of medical science, decades of medical research, and all the professionals trying to save the child's life, because they would rather *their child die* than to admit that their beliefs could possibly be unfounded even once, yet in that same moment they expect everyone trying to save their child's life should put aside their beliefs (also doesn't matter what the kid believes apparently, or that they probably never taught the child there were any other choices). In order to make such a decision they would have to beleive that they have special superhuman insight into *exactly* what happens after you die. They don't, nobody does. Best case scenario they are extremely ignorant parents guilty of extreme neglect and manslaughter, worst case they are a narcissistic child killers with unjust legal protections, I just don't see another way to interpret this.\n\nIt doesn't just stop at their own bodies or even their own children's bodies, narcissists have to have control over all aspects of *everyone's* life. We see theists do this every day, Christians banning abortion & IVF, Muslims instituting Sharia law in Afghanistan, and Zionist Jews who can't even stand the idea that Muslims could be *alive* within 1000 miles of them. Even \"spiritualities\" have this trait as well, like Pagan \"witches\" who believe they can control others behavior with spells, Astrologists who believe they know you through your starsign better than you know yourself, or Tarot readers who try to influence your decision making with confirmation bias. It always comes back to controlling others.  Textbook Narcissism. \n\nThe same framework applies to any supernatural belief, if you think that your belief should superceed all evidence to the contrary (science)  just because it makes you feel good, even if it harms others, thats textbook narcissism. If your belief is superceded by science when science is convenient to you, like for medical care, therapy, or on the internet, but you discard science when it makes you feel good, then your beliefs weren't that strong or important to begin with, that would make you a hypocrite, and your belief/behavior is still narcissistic.\n\nThe arguments I often see against this idea tend to focus entirely on \"but belief makes people feel good\", which is a non-arguement. Narcissists feel good when they are selfish and when they hurt people, so feeling good about your belief does nothing to prove that its not narcissistic or that its acceptable. Also, I won't accept the \"good Christians/bad Christians\" approach because that is also a non-arguement. You can just say \"well not me and mine\" until the cows come home, deflecting is still not participating in the discussion. \n\nPlease provide specific examples which disprove this idea, rather than anecdotes. Your personal feelings about how your church has helped you or this one person you know, don't reduce the harm that your religion is doing out in the world. Explain how your religion/belief is not narcissistic, how it helped your community without proselytizing, or times where science could not solve a problem which religion/spirituality could. Id especially like to hear from Theists who dont accept the actions of other members of your religion and engage in activism (i.e. a Christian who protests other, more hateful Christians). Id like to come to a less angry and resentful place in my feelings about religion and spirituality, but I've yet to be provided with a real argument or solution to any of my issues which doesn't boil down to \"its how I was raised\", \"it makes me feel good\", or \"it's my right\".",

Additionally, you will get, \u201cToyota trucks number one. Foreign competition will force Merican manufacturers to make reliable bare bones machines for work\u201d. While I understand that argument, the Chicken Tax is not that big of an issue. In order to circumvent the tax, the vehicle just has to be made in a USMCA country. The truck doesn\u2019t even need to come from an American brand. That is why the Toyota Tacoma and Ford Maverick are built in Mexico. Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Subaru, Mazda, and Hyundai were able to market pickups in the US, even with the tax in place. The CAFE regulations are likely the culprit for big trucks, a common complaint in the car enthusiast community. The tight fuel economy requirements for small vehicles incentivizes truck brands to build larger vehicles because those requirements are easier to meet. That\u2019s why US\u2019s best selling model, F150, is gargantuan and will make an European faint. As a result, enthusiasts have complained that large pickup trucks are dangerous to pedestrians and roads. This is why the Santa Cruz and Maverick were built and why Kei trucks are popular. Despite being old and lethargic, kei trucks remain a small but growing fan base in the US. More attention should be paid towards adjusting the CAFE standards than the Chicken Tax.",

        "author": "NASAfan89",
        "selftext": "In the US, people put such a huge cultural emphasis on the value of hard work, and it's really not very intelligent.  They want people to be working all the time.  Work 2 jobs, work a job or two jobs while you're also going to college...  Work work work.  The thing is, hard work is increasingly becoming worth less and less. Some of the hardest working people in the world are paid the least (like vegetable pickers on farms, or people who work in meat processing plants, for example), and social connections, intelligence, or coming from a wealthy family are more important and useful predictors of success in the economy.\n\nNot to mention that the wealthy make a lot more money than the typical person does in their [bs job](https://www.vox.com/2018/5/8/17308744/bullshit-jobs-book-david-graeber-occupy-wall-street-karl-marx#:~:text=Bullshit%20jobs%20are%20everywhere,%20David%20Graeber) just by raking in money from their stock portfolios and other investments.\n\nWhich brings me to another point.  A lot of jobs are just not that useful to society and are in the process of being taken over by machines. Check out the fast food places that are now operated by robots for one example of this. In the absence of an abundant supply of fast food laborers, businesses would just work to automate those jobs faster.\n\nI think hard work is valued so much by society for three main reasons:\n\n1. It serves the interests of those who have money & property by being able to blame the average person for their own financial problems by just claiming they have problems because they just didn't work hard enough, which distracts judgmental normies from the wealthy elites swimming in money as everyone else suffers.\n2. Normies who work in bs jobs tell themselves they're working hard because it makes them feel like a valuable and good person, particularly when they denigrate others in society who, in their view, aren't working as hard as they are. Lets be honest... everyone loves feeling like they're better than others.\n3. People like to imagine that people who work harder are rewarded for that because it creates the illusion that there is an element of fairness to the massive wealth disparities of society.\n\nAnd a lot of people will argue the problem is that some of these people who work hard aren't doing work that is smart enough, as if studying more and intelligence are what is needed.  However, this isn't exactly true either.  There is a lot of truth to the phrase:  *\"it's not what you know, it's who you know.\"* Cronyism gets you better jobs, promotions, and money arguably more effectively than either hard work or even intelligence.\n\nEven if it was true though that smart work was the solution, it wouldn't really make the system more ethical or moral because no person is morally responsible for being born with an IQ of 120 instead of 80. And that higher IQ opens up all sorts of doors for a person.  Like, can you be a highly paid doctor with your career, or do you end up working an unpleasant and poorly paid job?\n\nTo which some people say \"life isn't fair... get used to it\"... but then neglect to consider the fact that this demand undermines the values system they also espouse when they say people who work hard deserve more rewards.\n\nPlacing such value on hard work in the context of a republic like the US is even more questionable considering those who spend all their time working probably aren't paying much attention to what is going on in the world of politics. (If you work two jobs, or attend a college while working a job, honestly... who has time?) It's obviously a recipe for disasters and bad government policies that waste financial resources (the fruits of people's \"hard work\"...lol) and screw the society.\n\nIt's all a big lie.  The \"life isn't fair... get used to it\" response is the most honest, but if you're going to say that you shouldn't also emphasize the value of hard work and deserved rewards because for the many reasons stated that view is bs. It' all seems very arbitrary.",

Well my opinion is sometimes they CANT be included. If it\u2019s a competitive sports team, you need to be competitive and if having a disability will prevent this, then they shouldn\u2019t just be included because they have a disability. \n\nAnd as for birthday parties, if it\u2019s the age where the whole class gets invited, then invite the whole class. But if it\u2019s past that, then there\u2019s no reason to invite the disabled kid unless your kid is actually friends with them. \n\nI don\u2019t believe in special treatment due to disabilities. Accommodations, sure absolutely. But they should not be included for the sake of inclusion or elevated above others just because they have a disability. ",

The definition of pride. I am white. Did I do anything to become white? Did I have a choice in being white? No. I am perfectly content that I am white. I love myself and everything about me. But should I be proud for something that wasn't in my control? No. I don't care what race you are. You should not have pride and show your pride in something that wasn't your decision. I don't even think race should matter at all. I don't believe white people should be treated in stereotypes of \"being white supremacists\". I don't think that ANY race should be given its own stereotypes.\n\nThis leads to other stereotypes. There are SOO many unnecessary and untrue stereotypes. Let me disregard a few.  \nPeople with EV cars are not all liberals. People with diesel cars are not all conservatives.  \nBeing a strong white man does not make give you \"White toxicity\". It's not bad to work on your body.  \nConservatives are not Nazi's. In any way. I'm sure there are a few conservatives who could be. But as a whole, I have never met a conservative that thinks anything positive of Nazi's. And I know a lot of conservatives.  \nLiberals are not all unhealthily woke and hypocrites. Just the ones on Reddit.  \nChristians are not hypocrites. Some are, but they aren't all Christians, they just claim to be.  \nSatanists don't all believe in Satan. They just named their denominations of it off Satan because they are anti-Christian. I have a LeVeyan Satanist friend. Those who follow that type do not actually believe in a Satan. I think my friend is misguided, but we chll as can be.\n\nSo yup. Hash it out in the comments.",

And I'm not just talking about the still politically (though not scientifically) refuted anthropogenic climate change. Just generally not allowing anyone or any company to throw their waste, solid, liquid or gas, anywhere they want. Products that last a few days or weeks shouldn't be packaged in something that hangs around in the world chemically unchanged for thousands of years. Packaging manufacturers need to be incentivized to develop products that are degradable or easily recyclable. Until then we can expect the trash gyres in the Pacific to grow and others to form. Continue this growth path and our great grandchildren can enjoy oceans more covered in trash than not.\n\nI believe we need to be rational about gun control. It's a very broad interpretation of the second amendment (I've read it many times, it's not long) that allows for unrestricted gun ownership for all citizens. Read it and explain to me why it references \"state militia\" if it really applies to citizens as individuals? Explain to me how it forbids any sensible restrictions such as requiring a licensing test much like a driver's license? Why would any sensible person be against that? I don't want an unlicensed gun owner next to me for the same reason I don't want an unlicensed driver in the next lane.\n\nI believe that the divide between the extremely wealthy and the middle class has increased too much. I'm not sure how to solve this, but consider my example. In the 2000s I worked for a company that reviewed earnings and profits quarterly with all employees. Our goal, when I started, was 20% revenue growth and 20% net income growth each quarter. We hit it so often that when I left it had increased to 30 / 30. My salary? It increased 15% over 7 years. Bonuses? Under 5% of salary, usually not the 10% originally promised. The company, single owner, was growing over 30% year over year. Also, the company billed time and a half for any work we did after hours. Not only did we not see any of that, but we were strongly discouraged from taking a day off the week following weekend work. If we did, it often came out of our PTO. Just to be clear, after a 60 hour week with 8 hours plus Monday through Friday, and another 8 or more on Saturday, we were required to work at least a full 40 the following week. And we didn't get paid for the extra hours. Meanwhile the owner was pocketing 30% more each quarter. I never got a quarterly raise or bonus. I'm not saying owners don't deserve to benefit, but is it right that they take so much and give so little? When the highest paid person in a company makes hundreds of thousands of times more money than the lowest paid employee how can you logically argue that they provide that much more value to the company? The rules and regulations governing the market make it seem like they do, but is the accounting truly accurate? What variables are missing?\n\nI believe in the sanctity of the human body. Nobody should have the right to tell another person what they can or cannot do with their own body. We don't force people to donate organs even after they're dead. So why is it ok to force a woman to expel a dead fetus \"naturally\" at the risk of future pregnancies and their life itself? (It's called a D&C and although it's usually legal, procedures have been challenged and women have died). The government shouldn't place itself in the way of a mother, her doctor and her potential child. A potential human is not a human, and should have no legal rights, and certainly not to the body in which it resides. Religious? God created women so that for almost 9 months, no other individual can replace her. No technology exists that can put that fetus in another person or allow it to live outside the mother. God trusted mothers, humans should too. Late term abortions? How many women really go through a long, laborious pregnancy only to abort at the last minute just, \"because\"? And if a pregnancy is really viable at that late stage, no doctor \"aborts\". The woman gives birth. The baby is NOT murdered, and yes, it would be murder because the baby can live outside the mother. There's already laws against that so no need to panic the ignorant that it actually happens.\n\nI believe separation of church and state. The idea is not just in the Bill of Rights, it's also in the general body of the Constitution.\n\nI believe in a person's right to be free from government prosecution for what they say, and that the government should not be allowed to stop them from saying it. I also believe that corporations do not share those rights. A company is not \"a person\" and allowing a company to donate money to political campaigns in the guise of \"free speech\" is preposterous. In the same way that a newspaper, radio station, tv station, or social media platform (aka companies, corporations, or organizations) can't be required to allow all people to use its service to speak, they shouldn't be afforded the same rights as individuals when \"speaking\". If the CEO or Chairman of a company wants to donate personal money to a campaign, let them. But a corporate leader shouldn't be allowed to use corporate money and corporate employees speaking on behalf of the company, maybe even against their individual opinion, to influence the political process.\n\nI believe that, while an individual member of the media can speak freely without government prosecution, if they lie as the representative of a media company, the company should be held liable. In other words, when a Fox News host claims that the election was stolen without supplying evidence, they cannot be prosecuted or held liable except under the already very strict rules. Fox News, however, should enjoy no such protection. They should be held liable when their statements can be proved false. Whether it was just the \"opinion\" of their representative or not, whether it was done with malice or not, it's a statement that can be proved factually true or false, and the media organization should be held accountable for broadcasting the lie. Slippery slope or not, we're slipping in the wrong direction when mass media outlets are allowed to willfully mislead the public. And to all those screaming \"the mass media is already liberally biased\", there's a big difference between using adjectives to elicit a specific emotional response, and lying about the facts. For example, saying \"illegal immigrants are eating pets\" is a statement that can be factually proven. When no proof surfaces, it's a lie. When people in the community and community leaders claim it's not true, then it's a lie. It is the media outlet's responsibility to clearly state it's a lie, when an attempt is made to use their medium to spread it. Don't think the lie, \"illegal immigrants eat pets\" requires censure? Even up to the early 20th century, Jews in Europe were falsely and broadly accused of using the blood of Christian babies for Passover wine. See the similarity?\n\nI believe in the market, but also realize that \"free market\" is an impossible myth. Markets require rules to function, otherwise all disagreements would devolve into violence. Objections  citing \"free market\" should be dismissed out of hand. Instead, explain how the legislation will shape the market in a bad direction.\n\nAll human organizations are dysfunctional to some degree. Corporations are not inherently more functional just because they are singularly focused on money and profits. Government organizations are not inherently less functional just because they have different and often difficult to define goals. Government organizations should not be obsessed with the bottom line. They should stick to their budget, and spend money wisely, but their goal is to provide a service, not to save or make money. When a corporation is hired to provide the service, they will attempt to extract profit. If the organization they're replacing was well run, their only recourse is to cut services. And if it was poorly run, they'll cut some fat for the first few years, but where will they cut when the fat's gone? Really think for profit organizations stop seeking profit?\n\nI believe in a strong federal government and a strong U.S. military, and I'd argue that modern conservatives do too, because they keep increasing Presidential executive power. I also believe that finding Presidential Immunity in the constitution is a stretch of logical imagination that Socrates might be proud of. We all learned in grade school that our founders didn't want a king which is why we have a president. Kings are immune, Presidents are accountable.\n\nI believe Social Darwinism is a grave misapplication of the theory of evolution. Especially in light of research proving that large trees in a forest send excess sugars down and out through their roots to neighboring trees, helping younger and shorter vegetation of all types to flourish. Not to mention all the nutrient sharing that occurs between plants via the fungus that surrounds their roots. Evolution is more complicated than a selfish individual struggle for survival. Often, the survivors have survived because they've cooperated with others in their environment, instead of fighting.\n\nThese are just broad strokes and certainly incomplete. Feel free to categorize my beliefs as you see fit. I'm happy knowing where I stand. I'm also flexible enough to change my opinions based on new evidence. Are you?\n\n  \n#semi\\_wild\\_cat",

Purely testing recall on exams is no longer viable in the Information Age.\nAs a side note, let me add that these sentiments should not apply to grade school coursework. Students need to learn the basics on their own and recall should be tested at that level. I also do not condone the use of generative AI even though it is commonplace in work settings now. Students should be able to think and communicate critically. At higher levels though (college and up) recall should not be tested because there is simply too much information.

If you notice a friend heading down a bad path, such as they stop exercising and start eating unhealthy junk food all the time and start gaining weight, the kind thing to do is address this behavior (in a kind manner of course - no insulting) and state your concerns. Think about it: if you care for a person, you don\u2019t want to see them get hurt or kill themselves with bad habits.\n\nBut the leftist way to deal with such a situation is to tell the friend: you\u2019re beautiful just the way you are, you don\u2019t need to change a thing. While in the moment, this might make you feel good and your friend feel comforted, it sets your friend up for failure in the long run.\n\nThis is one of many examples.

I see a lot of people saying \"Israel is committing mass genocide\" and allat but I think it's not fair to say that since during the beginning of the war, Hamas (the Palestinian military group) that was recognized by the Palestinian government fired missiles at Israel in which Israel retaliated with more missiles which I think is somewhat fair.  It's what literally every country in war does if they get bombed.  (Aside from a few exceptions)  Firing missiles and holding citizens hostage was a dick move and if Israel was the only ones that did it, I would have to shut up but Palestine retaliated by holding Israelites hostage as well.  I don't really trust Aljazeera cause the website seems a bit biased at times.  The cause of this entire war was Israel trying to kick Muslims out of Palestine (I think) but isn't that what Muslims literally did to the Sudanese tribes back in 1983?  Additionally, I think if the ones Israel wanted to kick out was not Muslims and some other small community, it wouldn't have been that big of a deal.  I just want to add this is from a viewpoint of someone who is like not Muslim or Jewish (Not on team Israel or Palestine) and was observing the war a little bit ever since the beginning and I would like someone to give me a quick run down on why Israel or Palestine is in fault cause right now, the problem in my opinion is the government.  Everything is because of government.  Except for the people on top of the highway holding flags.  I'm afraid one would drop one day and I'll just crash into something.",

Im on mobile and every time i try to tap the spot to fix, it jumps me back to the bottom of the text and i dont feel like copy and pasting into notes to edit and repasting it*",

Obviously I\u2019m against someone changing their sex legally but if they want to present themselves socially as a different sex that\u2019s totally fine. \n\nHowever Kris is a coward. Kris got married and had a kid, that was his life decision and duty and commitment. Him choosing to change his gender, and leaving his wife then stripping his kids from a father figure is completely wrong and a cowardly move. He had a duty and a responsibility and he abandoned it to live out his personal fantasy. \n\nHim coming out as trans isn\u2019t the issue if he was single with no kids, it\u2019s the fact that him transitioning lead him to leaving his family and becoming an absent father (figure) is the issue. So sometimes the \u201cbravery\u201d of coming out of the closet does not outway the responsibility you abandoned in the process. ",

        "author": "firedragon77777",
        "selftext": "One day, we may turn Mother Nature into Daughter Nature, enveloping the biosphere with technology.\n\nSo, a while back I had an idea that I just can't stop thinking about, and to me it sounds oddly poetic. We've all heard of Mother Nature, and that name is typically used to describe nature (the biosphere, not the universe) as something outside of us, something that we're merely one part of, however with interstellar colonization, megastructures, self replicating machines, post biological life, genetic engineering and completely new exotic life, that *by definition* would no longer be true. Instead of Mother Nature taking us into her earthy embrace, we suddenly get *Daughter Nature*, clinging shyly to the dress of *Mother Technology*. The roles have reversed now, civilization no longer needs the, or really *any* biosphere, let alone the one we're familiar with.\n\nAnd even in the case of terraforming that implies us coming *before* nature and being the only thing really keeping it afloat for a very long time, and if it becomes self sustaining faster, it'll be because *we* helped it along. And even then such a civilization would outlive nature, out amongst the stars terraforming new planets which will one day wither and die without their masters keeping the ever growing flames of the stars at bay, and cradling their frail forms with warmth as the universe around them freezes over. And in reality it's even more imbalanced than that, *our technology itself* would be like a vastly superior ecosystem merging the best hits of evolution and innovation together to make technology so robust that *it's* the one overgrowing into the *ecosystems* after some apocalyptic scenario, not the other way around. Machines that can self replicate, repair, and work at every scale form nano to mega in one big \"fractalization\" of fully automated machinery that functions as a bodily reflex of post-biological human descendants that have full control over their minds and bodies. And technology could easily never malfunction either, there's already life that never ages or gets cancer, and while no organism is immune to sickness, having nanites basically means that by default as we could adapt exponentially faster than even the fastest mutations and just annihilate them eternally, always winning as we just adapt faster. And science can't go on forever, the universe is only so complex, eventually we will know every question that has a definitive answer and isn't just philosophical, and we'll have posed every philosophical question and possible answer out there, even if we can't test those hypotheses. And the completion of science (or at least reaching a point of vastly diminishing returns with only very minir adjustments occasionally made for new situations) should probably take no more than 10,000 years, perhaps even fewer than 1000. And everything for billions of lightyears can be ours, the stars themselves packed up into cold storage and brought back as a hoard of fuel to last us far longer than the death of the last stars would've been.\n\nAnd when there are ecosystems, they're made by our own hand, crafted with love and made in our image, countless forms of life that evolution could've never dreamed of, even on aliens worlds. Instead of humanity being but one species of millions in a planetary ecosystem billions of years old, we get an entire biosphere being just one little curious attraction among *trillions* of such experiments, and not particularly important to civilization as a whole, which is now more technology than biology, being able to shape themselves just as they shape the life around them. Human nature is no longer treated like a law of reality, it's just a design that can be changed at will, allowing us to advance morally, intellectually, and be better adapted to deep space where there is no greenery.\n\nHonestly, I think the most likely fate of Earth is not as a nature preserve, but a gigantic megastructual hub for most of humanity of tens of thousands of years to come, covered mostly in computronium for vast simulated worlds and unfathomable superintelligent minds, and swarmed by countless O'Neil Cylinders filled with various strains of life, ranging from the familiar, to the prehistoric, to the alien, to wacky creations straight out of fever dreams.\n\nNow, many people may say this is pure hubris, indeed many already have. However, although a bit of a philosophical tangent, the very idea of \"hubris\" is fundamentally flawed. Does ambition make one a bad person? Are there some ambitions that are just magically too big? How does one even draw the line of what's too arrogant to even think about trying? Is it still bad even if it's physically possible? Or if it both possible *and* proven to be beneficial? A good rule of thumb is that \"If it exists, we can understand, utilize, replicate, and improve upon it\". This rule is less common in physics as there's not much you can do to improve on fundamental particles and forces, indeed most particles are completely useless, but everything emerging from physics into more complex structures operates this way. If anything, nature is the thing we're *most* guaranteed to master, as it's a complex physical structure we can pick apart and study, not some abstract physical force like dark energy.\n\nNow, before you say \"But, nature is just the universe!\" I'm aware that definition tends to be used, but I'm taking the colloquial definition of nature as synonymous with the biosphere, specifically the one that has naturally evolved as opposed to being engineered by us through genetic interventions like selective breeding. For the other definition of nature, we're essentially the next phase, like the leap from prokaryotic to eukaryotic life, the thing which took billions of years to occur. Always remember, evolution is speeding up exponentially, progress is the number one rule of existence right now, the sentiment of \"there's nothing new under the sun\" died the moment the industrial revolution started, and truth be told it was never really true to begin with, now the reality is just undeniable.\n\n\"But isn't this all pure fantasy?\" No, not any more than any other speculation about the future, in fact it's vastly more grounded than most science fiction concepts like FTL. It operates entirely on the known laws of physics, and uses technologies we either have some primitive analog to, or can at least conceive of without any new physics. In fact, the Kardashev Scale alone is a quite grounded idea with wide scientific acceptance. And even very near-term technologies like climate-controlled arcologies, nuclear fusion, and hydroponics mean we're independent from nature by default, afterall there are no ecosystems in space, so the moment we can support a man throughout his entire life up in space, using only resources from space, the age of biosphere reliance has come to an end.\n\nAdditionally, I've considered renaming the concept to Grandmother Nature, as it seems a but more fitting, though Daughter Nature still makes more sense in the context of terraforming and artificial life.\n\nThis has definitely been a hot take everywhere else I post this. In short, nature is not something sacred or spiritual, it's just poorly designed machinery, machinery we can change in due time. And to those who say we should preserve nature, it doesn't even preserve itself! It's not harmonious or stable, and in truth it's unbelievably vicious. Not to mention, we don't even need actual nature psychologically, just some occasional greenery and nice parks, that's hardly \"natural\". To those who say nature is wise, it has even done exactly what we're doing now, creating pollution that nearly wiped out all life during the Great Oxygenation Event. And there's no logic behind wanting to preserve the exact environment we have now indefinitely, in fact that would be quite *unnatural* (not that that matters). To those who say nature is powerful, it's just a tiny coating of moss covering a fraction of a speck of dust, orbiting another speck of dust swirling around in the void. Technology could let us move beyond this tiny scale and take the whole damn galaxy and turn it into something beautiful. We could live to see the earth crumble to dust and blow away in the cosmic winds, or even disassemble it ourselves, or preserve it long after all the stars have died, maybe even preserving some modern ecosystems.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/EXTX1GLC5gg?si=ph8Lauw3LBC_YxPC Here's a video that's definitely adjacent to this idea and takes an overall supportive stance of it, but doesn't just shrug off the melancholy of it either.",

But just so many of the, clearly fake, stories I see, have female characters who are described to be the worst human beings imaginable. The, typically male (but not always), OP, will consistently describe them in really derogatory ways, and then retaliate back in ways that are often cruel (insisting they've tried every normal resolution already). \n\nAnd are then praised for doing the right thing by others in the comments, because the female character seems to always have it coming?\n\nI don't think that I've worded this quite right, but I think you can still get the general idea.\n\nAm I just overreacting, or is this like, an actual thing??",
